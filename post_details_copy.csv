130,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"I left X to escape the political war but honestly, it’s going on here too.

132,3 December 2024 at 21:00,DSAers who’ve left X - our statement on the events in South Korea are below:
133,1 December 2024 at 21:44,Let me be clear: I left X bc of Elon. His takeover of the internet town square - where many were getting their news - and his leveraging of that purchase to rewrite the narrative and an election with his very specific brand of rightwing misinformation is vile and an absolute abuse of his wealth.
134,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"Honestly these kind of articles are pathetic.

Many non Americans have left X because it's a shit platform, and they don't want to support a website that the richest man in the world owns and is using to push racist conspiracy theories. Fuck all to do with US politics."
135,1 December 2024 at 17:34,"Honestly these kind of articles are pathetic.

Many non Americans have left X because it's a shit platform, and they don't want to support a website that the richest man in the world owns and is using to push racist conspiracy theories. Fuck all to do with US politics."
136,4 December 2024 at 05:29,"Media always had more power to do RIGHT than they’ve exercised, especially in the past 8 years.  Today, they’re just cowed billionaires & corporations. 
If they left X, everyone else would leave.
Takes a bit of backbone, of course…& they’re more like fascist-enabling jellyfish."
137,2 December 2024 at 00:02,"I don't like Elon but simple personal animus isn't why I left. X is a terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE, user experience. Bots and ads all over the place, a gameified algorithm that puts only trolls in my mentions, and it shadowbanned my biggest account. Purity politics isn't what's happening."
138,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"It really bothers them that we left X. Living in their head, rent free. 🤯"
139,1 December 2024 at 04:21,"It really bothers them that we left X. Living in their head, rent free. 🤯"
140,1 December 2024 at 20:59,"@politico.com
I left X  because Musk was/is using Goebbels's propaganda techniques to a Tee; it's the next part of the growing Republicans/ MAGA disinformation machine.

That's one hell of a good reason to leave that cesspool of vile, violent rhetoric & threats from brainwashed individuals behind."
141,2 December 2024 at 04:43,"I also didn’t leave X because I don’t like Elon.

I left X because I no longer liked X. 

I also don’t like Jeff Bezos, or the concept of Amazon, but I still have Prime because Amazon still provides a useful service. 

This is a straw man."
142,3 December 2024 at 23:54,"I don’t think X is going to survive once that orange turd takes over. It will only degrade further and further as it goes.

I did see an international journalism group have stopped posting and left X. 295,000 members covering 44 countries"
143,2 December 2024 at 14:53,"I think all of us left X for a reason, so there is no reason we should be seeing screenshots from X with Republican hot takes on Hunter’s pardon. Let them cry over there."
144,4 December 2024 at 17:55,"I wish he'd start posting those butt-cheek pics to Bluesky that he talks about posting on Twitter. /j

Genuinely, would be awesome if he left X to post on Bluesky."
145,1 December 2024 at 15:46,All of these allstaredge links look just like the right wing propaganda links to me. I left X to avoid this shit.
146,1 December 2024 at 16:38,"I never signed up for X; I joined Twitter.

So in a way, I never actually left X because I never agreed to be on X."
147,2 December 2024 at 02:15,"Hey all, like many I left X As soon as he bought it. I'm an atheist and progressive so as you can imagine, it wasn't really my environment."
148,3 December 2024 at 08:43,Amen! Left X and rarely use FB too. Bad energy vibes.
149,1 December 2024 at 19:51,"I left X because:

1. I was sick of getting attacked by Nazis
2. My links to my creative work on multiple platforms were throttled for years
3. The new Twitter TOS allows a world-wide license to X over the work I do post
4. I'm not monetarily supporting a billionaire who wants to take my rights"
150,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"My favourite* kind of post here at the moment is the people who left X in the last month and signed up here who say ""I can't believe people are still posting over there"", like it wasn't all obviously going to go the way it did the moment Musk walked through the door."

Hopefully those of you who left X for here will find me and me you. Migrating to this place."
154,29 November 2024 at 21:33,KEEP POLITICS OFF MY PAGE PLEASE. I LEFT X CAUSE OF THAT
155,2 December 2024 at 01:02,Aren’t you glad that you left X? 💙🦋💙
156,1 December 2024 at 18:02,"Note how we NEVER see articles about Truth Social being an ""echo chamber"" that needs to ""be open to opposing viewpoints"".

Also, presenting the Xodus like this is a blatant attempt to simplify the issue into something that can be weaponized.

I left X for SO many reasons.
And I'm glad I did."
157,1 December 2024 at 16:44,"LEFT X (where I have over 3k followers).

159,1 December 2024 at 15:03,"In 12 days the growth rate of Bluesky dropped from 11 people per second to ~2 people. It’s now around 24 million people which for a social media platform is small. X has over 600 million active users (April 2024). About 115,000 people left X after the election  (according to The Economic Times)."
160,2 December 2024 at 14:39,"Same. They were all “We left X cause we’re the good guys”

Screw ALL media. Dollar chasing corrupt douche nozzles."
161,1 December 2024 at 03:53,"Ok Salty. I left X due to the hate and homophobia, and came across something that I read far too many times over there."
162,2 December 2024 at 02:21,Don’t care. One of the reasons I left X is so I don’t have to hear her screeching monkey whiney baby complaints.
163,29 November 2024 at 13:03,This is part of why we all left X.
164,3 December 2024 at 18:13,"X users. I left X months ago. I was here. The last 2 days the attacks have begun. X users get the fuck back to X if want to be dipshits. Lefties, Righties or Tighties, I don't care. GTFO if you want this to be X.2. Cheers."
165,3 December 2024 at 18:05,I left X for the same reason I don't spend holidays with my family. It's not worth dealing with 100 MAGA assholes to spend time with the one nice sane one. The two of us can interact elsewhere. X is NOT required in my life. I don't know why this guy thinks so.

167,30 November 2024 at 16:46,It particularly annoys me when people post screenshots of some bullshit from X just so they can make some indignant “can you believe this!” comment. MF WE LEFT X FOR A REASON!
168,4 December 2024 at 18:29,"💯 I wish for the day when liberal readers of NYT realize that they can leave it the same way they left X and instead support papers that do journalism well. Yes, NYT has some excellent journalists but that alone clearly doesn’t guarantee good journalism."
169,1 December 2024 at 16:24,"And no one left X because “they don’t like Elon.” They left because of what he did to X, making it an unusable platform."
170,1 December 2024 at 18:32,"Politics is really a vanishingly small part of the reason I left X. 

I don’t think I want to give my time and attention to a platform that’s run by an unhinged, drug-addled billionaire who openly wishes harm on federal workers like me. 

Why is this hard for journalists to understand."
171,1 December 2024 at 15:13,I left X because they were mean. I am starting all over again. I am still looking for the 15K people following me and who I was following. A lot of people like me changed their names. I hope people keep finding me.

174,30 November 2024 at 03:22,"Fake Dispatch... OUT! 
I didn't leave Twitter. Twitter left me. I left X."
175,30 November 2024 at 17:34,Left X as soon as Musk bought it.
176,1 December 2024 at 18:36,"I left X because it was overwhelmed with stupidity, either real or chosen."
177,4 December 2024 at 19:06,"Do not kid yourselves.  Joe Rogan is a smart man.  He knows exactly what he is doing.   It is very sad how he uses his power lately to denigrate the people of Ukraine.  I left X to escape hate, I am leaving Rogan to escape his Russian propaganda. Buh-bye Joe."
178,1 December 2024 at 17:16,"I did not know this was run by women.  That’s why it feels safe. I no longer feel dread when I open an app. 
So glad I left X."
179,1 December 2024 at 17:51,"I left X for a variety of reasons, but my main thing was engagement. I couldn’t get any meaningful interactions on X. As well, the majority of my followers were bots. I had like 60 or 70 bots follow me. This is funny too as potbellied blood emerald man was bitching about bots before ruining the site"
180,1 December 2024 at 18:05,"What a truly awful take. I left X months ago because I saw what the platform was becoming. Yes, that was due to Musk but there are plenty of reasons to leave X simply because of the shitification of the platform. Especially for women it is truly a horrible space"
181,1 December 2024 at 11:37,"I see your point & respect people's freedom of choice. But staying on X does provide that site with the capacity to monetise your data, even if the views you are expressing are countering its nasty, fascist messaging. I left X because I wanted NO part in condoning its existence by my participation."
182,2 December 2024 at 17:18,So glad to see you here Jon. I too left X for BLUER Skies!!!
183,1 December 2024 at 16:05,"Tbh, I left X because it sucked. The bots, the people lying for clout, the bots, the pay to get verified... Elon is also very scummy too... I didn't wanna be in there any longer since that would mean I would be giving Elon money with ads, and that personally made me stop posting there."
184,1 December 2024 at 17:00,i have spent time engaging with rl MAGA people (my friends of 20 years) I finally had to walk away it was to painful and i tried hard. I left X and elon before it was a thing. Why is trusting our hearts and guts and trying to follow what is right a 'woke' movement.. their label not ours dont buy it
185,1 December 2024 at 15:58,"…and just like that, here’s an example of what I mean. 

I left X because I like to get on social media and talk about science fiction, horror, comic books, tv shows, and titties with people who are into those things. Elon made Twitter into an unusable mess that was antithetical to those goals. 🤷🏾‍♂️"
186,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"I left ""X"" because it became a hate-filled cesspool as the result of Musk's policies.  That is not the same as ""Because I don't like Elon.""

Nuanced reasoning is not a hallmark of MAGA."

188,1 December 2024 at 18:28,"Actually, Democracy is in a mess. Partly because of the rise of unregulated social media). But, it’s also down to the unwillingness of trad media (including Politico) to speak truth to power.

I left X because it is a fascist organ that has been used by an oligarch to dismantle democracy in the US."

200,1 December 2024 at 19:19,I left “X” because it wasn’t “Twitter” anymore . . .
201,2 December 2024 at 11:43,"I left X because it's not Twitter. It's not fun. It's not engaging me, nor useful, even the ads are trash."

204,1 December 2024 at 21:35,What will you do when X fails? For awhile you‘ll have almost no followers. You should start connecting on here now with your X followers who have not yet left X.
205,30 November 2024 at 19:45,"Having left X in August and gone all in on Bluesky, for a few months I was v much *not* across breaking or current news. That has changed in recent weeks- now critical mass of journos & reporters which is great.

The final piece of resurrecting here what was good about over there, is complete."
206,30 November 2024 at 14:30,"Except when I see Trump tweets on here. A big account blocked me recently because I expressed my extreme distaste for that. I left X for that specific reason. I have no desire to hear him, see him, read what he has to say, much less have big accounts on here share his bs for clicks."

This is not democracy, this is chaos."
226,1 December 2024 at 20:43,"I left X because it was a sham and incompetently run, but apparently making a sane choice for quality interaction elsewhere is ""political"" now?"

228,2 December 2024 at 15:01,"I left X last week.  However since last night I've been itching to go back to see MAGA heads exploding and hypocritical ranting over Hunter Biden's pardon.  Let's see?  Didn't Trump pardon Kushner's father?  How about Steve Bannon?  How many dozens of ""friends"" got pardoned under Trump?"
229,29 November 2024 at 21:25,"If you've been on any platform for a significant amount of time, then deleting your account isn't simply an unemotional thing to check off your list. You've spent years building relationships.

236,30 November 2024 at 16:18,"I keep hoping this is a short phase and it will stop after a few more weeks, but dunking on X users is the kind of crap I left X for two years ago.

237,2 December 2024 at 06:51,"I see lots of people feeling like they have to defend why they left X today. Don't. You use whatever services you want. If on X or not, you always have the final say in how you use your time."
238,2 December 2024 at 17:31,"Agreed. As you touch on at the end, I think, talking about how X may have been an unhelpful echo chamber even before its Musk-ification.

281,28 November 2024 at 18:57,I left X a while ago because it is a cesspool of MAGA hate posts. Post one thing that seems left of center and you get a plethora of insults and hate responses.

💀Arbitrary changes that negatively impact the growth of artists

And I used twitter since 2010!"

800,18 November 2024 at 00:35,"I left X with 23k followers but they’re disappearing quickly.
I came here because of the way Elon has changed the Xhitty platform to suppress democratic accounts and promote right wing maga propaganda and allow them to abuse and threaten us all.
Bluesky is a breath of fresh air."

811,17 November 2024 at 02:49,If every local news station’s female weather reporter left X for BluSky Elon would lose like 30% of his most active most users
812,17 November 2024 at 16:13,I’m a fan of irony. Twitter was bright & lovely until Musk turned it into a platform for ghouls and named it “X”. The good people left “X”.

817,17 November 2024 at 10:25,I left X so I didn’t have to see the bullshit on X but now I see screenshots of what people have posted on X all over the place and I have to ask - why do you care what kind of dialogue is being tossed onto that dumpster fire of a platform? Just let it go and chill.
818,16 November 2024 at 18:55,"I just had a guy yelling in my replies about how I was crybaby a who left X because I didn’t want to engage with ideas. 

His feed? Just genAI pictures of musclebound Trump with phrases like “Suck it libs.Trump is your daddy now.”

1431,10 November 2024 at 16:33,"Just left X, despite 177 k followers. Can’t stand the idea of enabling Elon Musk and his plutocratic dystopia in any way."
1432,11 November 2024 at 00:46,Just left X to avoid the toxic posts.   Hi y’all!
1433,11 November 2024 at 03:56,My first post on Blue Sky! I left X after 7 years and happy to be  here. I’m in Orlando and we have peacocks in our neighborhood which was an orange grove 60 years ago. The peacocks were kept to alert farmers with a loud honk if intruders tried to steal oranges!
1434,11 November 2024 at 15:18,"Cheers to all who have followed me here - 500 and growing! When I left X/Twitter, I was worried my link to many of the folks I followed there would disappear. It is wonderful to see the paleontologists & paleoartists who have migrated to this platform as well! I love seeing and hearing from you all!"
1435,10 November 2024 at 11:53,Left X hoping this place will flourish
1436,11 November 2024 at 01:05,I’m so glad to see you here Jack. I left X today. Love your podcasts.

I lived in the Pacific Northwest for 30+ years where I worked in logistics and manufacturing planning in the semiconductor industry. Retired to Arizona and then moved to Minnesota. I left X for the usual reasons. I like conversations. Happy to be here.

Absolutely rip into ideologies. But the personalised abuse and name calling and denunciations have to stop.

In my own case…"
1445,10 November 2024 at 19:48,"Bluesky must be getting more busy as I hit 500 followers today! 

It's not the 5000 I had on Twitter but I'm pretty sure half of those were bots 😅

Welcome to those who have left X this week!"
1446,11 November 2024 at 07:19,"Trying to figure this all out. Haven't completely left X. That's where I get my UTD news, taytay, tayvis, NFL, entertainment, reality shows and I still ❤️ dog twitter. A lot of those peeps haven't moved over yet. Any celebrities here?? Or big orgs?"
1447,10 November 2024 at 03:29,I have mixed feelings about the influx of X folks here given that I left X because of the people there
1448,11 November 2024 at 02:32,"New here, left X after 16 years, Threads opened the door for me. Now I am going try Bluesky. I hope to have a wonderful time here."
1449,10 November 2024 at 00:08,"Attention urban decision-makers:

I’m hoping to see city halls, mayors, city councillors & chief planners create & use accounts here on Bluesky.

Media too.

They were all on Twitter when it was THE place to be & used it effectively, but many have left X. 

I think Bluesky is the new place we need."
1450,10 November 2024 at 02:20,Remember when Kamala was running a great campaign and telling it like it is and catering to her base and giving everyone hope and then she suddenly stopped and started kissing Republican ass and then Trump got elected? It’s cause of this asshole.

1462,10 November 2024 at 13:40,See also people who left X because it was so terrible then come on here posting screenshots from X of terrible people's terrible opinions. Baffling.
1463,10 November 2024 at 14:03,Left X when Elon took over. Seems my instincts were correct. Decided to dip my toes in these waters. Hope my instincts are still in working order. So far so good!
1464,10 November 2024 at 16:01,This is exactly why I left X. I wasn't prominent enough to spark a pile on but there were still deeply unpleasant misogynistic comments sent my way and the constant bots were awful. Life's too short to deal with that rubbish.

I just left X yesterday.  I just couldn't take the cesspool anymore, so I found people I followed there, then proceeded to follow them here (if they'd established an account) after setting up an account."
1481,10 November 2024 at 13:18,"I think also that the educators have left X on mass and joined LinkedIn on mass so the platform has changed quite a bit. I would rather see posts on politics that pictures of food, shoes and cats?! 🤣🙈"

If so, why? 

If not, I'm curious on what makes you stay there? 🤔

2052,13 November 2024 at 19:50,I've been on X since it started as Twitter and on here for one day. For some reason my posts on X are getting a ton of likes and comments now and they never did before. Is it because so many have left X that the little people are finally getting noticed?

It has been a long time coming."

2338,17 November 2024 at 13:59,Another reason to have left X!
2339,17 November 2024 at 14:42,That's because all you losers left X because you can't take the heat.
2340,17 November 2024 at 14:52,Left X and ended up here by accident. Not sure it’s worth staying yet.
2341,17 November 2024 at 15:00,"You describe the worst part of social media debate. Ppl become devoid of all empathy & use anonymity as a shield.

I’m a lib centrist which makes me utterly hated by all. I left x bc I was tired of sifting through the strawmen & ad hom attacks for reasoned discussion.

I hope this place is better."
2342,17 November 2024 at 13:36,Though I have seen (presumably well-meaning) people trying to whip up mass-blockings of particular individuals. Usually those who don’t subscribe to ultra-left-wing orthodoxy. This “let’s fight intolerance with intolerance” approach feels antithetical to the reason most of us left X/Twitter.
2343,17 November 2024 at 13:37,I left X too. 1 million of us and counting. Feel certain Musk and his mega rich pals are planning to asset strip the planet so they can go and live on Mars or the moon. Am I becoming paranoid???
2344,17 November 2024 at 13:32,"I left X the day Elon bought it, so here’s hoping I will never encounter those clowns, (Musk and Ramaswamy), again."

2349,17 November 2024 at 16:50,I've been utilizing Threads since I left X months ago. Very positive vibes on Threads. Happy to check out blue sky.
2350,17 November 2024 at 17:40,"Right? I was so appalled by this post I left X. 
The Ukrainians have been going through unspeakable hell: being bombed, mamed, killed, raped, kidnapped. It is not their own making, it's Putin's. And this ""developmentally challenged"" POS just mocks them for it. 
I hope Elon will get what he deserves."

I feel cleansed having left X"
2356,17 November 2024 at 17:48,But you left X because you couldn't handle the few million that were on there.
2357,17 November 2024 at 18:03,I left X earlier this year as the vileness was really affecting my mental health (in a high stress level kind of way).  Threads has been lovely but I do wonder if I was totally blindsided by the IS election result because of the overwhelming amount of pro-Harris posts I was seeing there.
2358,17 November 2024 at 18:11,"Along with 300,000 X users, I left X (formerly Twitter). X has become extreme right, promoting hate speech, biased, devisive contents, and suspended one of my accounts just because of my comment in disagreement with one of Elon Musk's tweets. X is doomed with authoritarian CEO on the helm."
2359,17 November 2024 at 18:43,"Yay! Joined BlueSky just to follow Beyond the Trailer! (Left X a long time ago, and glad to have an alternative!)"

2380,19 November 2024 at 13:53,The @edinburghcouncil one is curious though. It states in the bio “for service related questions contact us on X at edinhelp”. Nooo! We all left X for a reason!!
2381,19 November 2024 at 06:53,Good thing you left x. I ended login out of the app and uninstaling it. Another thing just experienced trying to deactivate my x account. He's not letting me leave by having my password not funtion saying i entered it incorrectlly.

2384,19 November 2024 at 05:30,"I’m Russ. First post. I am here because, like a lot of people, I left X after the election. X has become too toxic/MAGA, and I deleted my account there. I like art, music (mostly Rock), camping, summer, and boating.  I voted for a more intelligent and kinder world than what we got instead. Crap"
2385,19 November 2024 at 04:42,I left X last week.  This app reminds me of what Twitter use to be....before the hostile takeover that was Elon Musk. Is it too much to ask for a decent debate where no one's 1st amendment right is threatened by bigoted remarks and childish behavior?
2386,19 November 2024 at 04:24,"Well for a start lots of gossip about how cutthroat you are while working in a dop ring.
Sort of like ""X"" without the racism, bigotry, hatred, flames, and trolls.

I left ""X"" over 2 years ago with a ""f"" Trump and have never gone back. Then I found this place"
2387,19 November 2024 at 04:45,Oh Medea. I left X to forget about nutcases like her.
2388,19 November 2024 at 04:25,I left X cause I felt like it
2389,22 November 2024 at 18:48,"People have left X because it is turning into a conservative echo chamber. It seems Bluesky may be turning into a progressive echo chamber, however this is a natural progression and it comes with precedent. It was common in the 19th Century for political parties to run their own (cont.)"
2390,22 November 2024 at 22:18,"Hi Folks! Here I am, joining the crowd who have rightly left X in the dust. Looking forward to being part of this social media group and sharing updates and craziness. Most recent news? I have works coming out soon in Michael Bailey's LONG DIVISION: STORIES OF SOCIAL DECAY and FUMPTRUCK."
2391,22 November 2024 at 22:33,"Here is my take on this. I left X for most of the expected reasons, but also because of the numbers and ratings. In roughly 5 years I got close to 1500 followers and was blocking 3 bots per day on average. It's been 3 months of BlueSky and I have already almost 500 and no bot. So this is better 🎸🚀"
2392,22 November 2024 at 22:36,"I have arrived! I feel like I just joined something that is going to be a big deal.
I left X long ago
I don't even look at Threads 
Now I'm here 
Let's go! 
#hellobluesky"
2393,22 November 2024 at 22:45,Do not miss MAGA in the least. Left X two weeks ago and my IQ shot up 6 points. ⬆️
2394,22 November 2024 at 19:31,I don’t know a single scientific colleague who left X for BS because they only want to talk to other scientists—IN FACT a lot of public health folk did NOT want to lose the ability to speak directly to non-scientists and science skeptics! An echo chamber is the last thing we want
2395,22 November 2024 at 20:06,"So strange, left X and just spent my first 10 minutes on here. I’m left feeling entertained and positive."
2396,22 November 2024 at 19:52,Well Inhave just left X. Sadly it has become a hate echo chamber and frankly it is exhausting reading it. Not my odea of a good social media platform.
2397,22 November 2024 at 19:58,Hi thanks for the follow back. I left x/twitter due to all the bad text I saw and had to read. A lot nicer on this app. I look forward to Ur content
2398,22 November 2024 at 19:04,"I don’t understand the article’s disconnect here. It’s the same crap we left X for.

It literally starts off showing conservatives posting hateful messages and then discusses whether they are being treated fairly with no acknowledgement of the content of the posts.

Stop normalizing hate."
2399,23 November 2024 at 00:48,"I want to thank everyone I am following and everyone that has followed me back.  

You have helped me feel less anxious and I feel like I have a tribe.  That I’m not alone. 

I left X and I’m glad I found you on here.  🦋"
2400,22 November 2024 at 22:13,I agree. I left X for good on 11.11.24 at 5:55 PM. Much better here on Bsky. 🦋
2401,22 November 2024 at 22:52,"I left X without recording who I was following and not interested in restarting my account to find them. Every day, I remember a couple more and go looking for them on Bluesky."
2402,22 November 2024 at 22:55,Seeing old posters who left x years ago here is like seeing characters who died in season 3 coming back for the series finale
2403,22 November 2024 at 23:31,I left 'X' after 10 years (mostly as Twitter) because it became so caustic & viscous so I'm with you; I'm hoping for a much happier experience here!
2404,22 November 2024 at 18:58,I have not left X. It is still superior.
2405,18 November 2024 at 20:19,Thank you for providing a platform that has nothing to do with elon MUSK I should have left x as soon as he brought . He tarnished his accomplishments when he became political siding with trump and bribing people to vote for him
2406,18 November 2024 at 19:32,One million people have left X (Twitter) after Trump's victory. Stats
2407,18 November 2024 at 19:46,"Nah, never left X"
2408,19 November 2024 at 17:59,You left X because you’re a beta cuck. You can handle the heat snowflake so you came to a new safe place.
2409,19 November 2024 at 18:07,I just left X.  Good to find to here!
2410,19 November 2024 at 18:02,Left X. Hi everyone ☺️
2411,19 November 2024 at 17:27,People left X just to turn Bluesky into their favorite legacy lying fake news portal
2412,19 November 2024 at 16:54,One of the reasons I left X
2413,19 November 2024 at 18:57,One of the reasons I left X
2414,19 November 2024 at 18:54,It’s funny how this reminds me of when everyone liked Tublr before they decided to restrict NSFW there so we went to MeWe (which I have none anymore) to how everyone left X for Bluesky lol
2415,19 November 2024 at 19:05,🙋‍♀️ I left x with almost 7k followers & now trying to get back there. 💙
2416,19 November 2024 at 19:07,We just left X behind and joined all of you. :) 👍😁
2417,19 November 2024 at 18:57,"guess it shouldn’t surprise me that an app filled with mostly folks who left x for political reasons would also be heavily political. 

i left twitter years ago bc it was very negative - any tips for making my feed more upbeat?"
2418,17 November 2024 at 00:40,I left X 4 years ago..Joined Thread and Bluesky..Have fun and looking for nice people in here.Good luck
2419,23 November 2024 at 01:35,Well I left X a while ago and just joined this site a week ago. I am Canadian and like free people around the world I am dismayed at what the USA has done to itself. I don’t see anyway out of the hole for you which will seriously impact the world. Everyone hold on for the ride!
2420,23 November 2024 at 07:07,"I've seen THIS hateful rhetoric, but strangely it doesn't appear to be coming from Magas.

This is *not* what I signed up for when I came to Bluesky. I think people here could do with some introspection. This is pretty much the same garbage I left X to avoid."
2421,22 November 2024 at 23:53,"Please watch that show instead of using MAGA attack type rhetoric so you can get subscribers! The hilarious thing is how much content for this and other high follower sites is regurgitated directly from ""mainstream media"" sites and reporters! It's this level of anger focus facilitation I left X for!"
2422,23 November 2024 at 03:52,"I love the ones ranting about “the libs” who left X for here.

What they’re basically saying is “How dare you leave me here with people like myself?”"
2423,23 November 2024 at 03:02,left X…..wassup blue sky!
2424,23 November 2024 at 04:33,"Finally left X!!! Tired of the insane echo chamber 💙💙💙
#blueAmerica"
2425,23 November 2024 at 04:07,Left X a week ago. Please follow back.
2426,23 November 2024 at 04:16,That’s why I left X I don’t want anything to do with musk and I don’t want him to lose lots of people on his site. I want Social to go in the toilet! That’s where both of those belong along with Trump!
2427,23 November 2024 at 03:16,"This is also one of the reasons why I left X/Twitter.... That fan base!!! Kendrick didn't even do anything to this woman. Also, the duckworths are nothing to play with!! Especially Kendrick's Dad!!!"
2428,22 November 2024 at 20:46,"Doing so now, the only reason they came here is because us sane people left X, they are bored and have no one to harass."
2429,23 November 2024 at 02:53,"Doing so now, the only reason they came here is because us sane people left X, they are bored and have no one to harass."
2430,23 November 2024 at 07:52,"So he left X, came here, and now leaving BlueSky because he cannot handle people from X coming over here? LOL."
2431,22 November 2024 at 15:56,This is why I left X for Blue Sky. I am done arguing with stupid people.
2432,22 November 2024 at 21:11,"Thank you!  

It's wonderful, left X, formerly known as Twitter, the day after Musk purchased it.
Nice to have a community with friends."
2433,22 November 2024 at 03:03,"Spastic? 

Remember, all you girls left X not because your speech was suppressed or threatened, but because ours wasn't.

You are the definition of petulant babies, but you project, like a good girly lib."
2434,22 November 2024 at 23:41,"Spastic?

2435,22 November 2024 at 23:58,I’m so glad all my miserable colleagues left X. Now they have even more time to cope and seethe after the election since everyone here agrees with them and validates them. X was almost too much freedom of speech.
2436,22 November 2024 at 23:38,"@neptunegaming.bsky.social
 Hello there, how are you doing? Hope things are well on your end since you left X? 😊 I wanted to let you know that I have Ruby on my island now, who I’m aware is one of your two birthday twins in Animal Crossing. 😊🤗😘💙💖 Xxxx"
2437,23 November 2024 at 00:04,"I just left X. I feel lighter already. Been there for ten years, it’s a total mess. Think I’ll stay here for a while."
2438,23 November 2024 at 17:33,"This is the kind of discussion I left X to get. Thank you for that. Please follow if you wish, you may want to respond to some other of my comments. LOL"
2439,23 November 2024 at 17:52,"Lol, I left X because of people like you. Let me be more direct."
2440,23 November 2024 at 19:09,"Hey, just left X today. Lost thousands of followers, but I'm happy to be here. I love vegan activism.
My most popular post on X was about veganism. And was my first post here too. Follow me. XOXO"

2442,23 November 2024 at 20:32,"""You people...""

Let me guess...you left X because of all the hate, right?"
2443,23 November 2024 at 20:07,I left X the moment they refused to make prefered pronouns mandatory
2444,23 November 2024 at 20:43,4-left X because it’s an Elon toy to promote fascism and it’s downright toxic. A cesspool of right wing degenerates. No thanks!
2445,17 November 2024 at 01:59,"Why are you even here? If it didn't sink in, we left X because we don't want to engage with people who lack morality & common decency. We will be fine & will simply block you from our lives-both online & in real life."
2446,17 November 2024 at 00:48,Thanks God..Many Squaddies left X....
2447,17 November 2024 at 00:38,"Different opinions are fine, but the accounts I’m referring to are ones that are clearly bot accounts.

You appear to have created some idea of the person I am, I never left X and wouldn’t, I’m just interested in how this place functions, clearly just like yourself."
2448,24 November 2024 at 12:04,I left X -and personal relationships - BECAUSE i understand how they feel. That’s the point.
2449,24 November 2024 at 12:13,"I like this...

1. I left x bcuz of the toxicity and the separation of our people. The clique-ish attitudes and all the negativity that comes of all that.
2. What I love about 
#bluesky
 is simply the opposite of why I left X. There is literally a sense of community and I LOVE how we fight 4 ea other."
2450,23 November 2024 at 20:20,"We left X for a reason because anything we posted, we would get bombarded with MAGA propaganda. We don’t approve of you stalking us over here. We have our platform, you have your platform. Quit stalking us."

2452,24 November 2024 at 14:20,"I appreciate your caring and the fight your fighting. I left X ( kind of , still there) and was hoping for a peaceful and better place. The more people joining the more fake accounts are joining. My follow backs are done to about 70%."
2453,24 November 2024 at 13:02,"It's Not What It's Groked Up To Be. 

One of the reasons I left X was due to the violence served up in my algorithm that I couldn't control. Beyond the hardcore pornography there are videos of gruesome murders, beatings, and dismemberments.

Grok is being trained on everything posted on X.

2454,24 November 2024 at 08:05,Paul I hope this means you finally left x
2455,24 November 2024 at 02:32,Hi! New here and looking to connect with other resisters! Left X with a smile💜
2456,24 November 2024 at 02:32,"Ok, all of you that left X, now do Facebook! 
#DeleteFacebook
 The platform responsible for the breakup of millions of families. I’m assuming my estimate is close to being an accurate statement."
2457,24 November 2024 at 07:05,Left “X🐤” because I needed trust and character around me!
2458,24 November 2024 at 07:07,"Life always resets itself.
You left X didn’t ya?"
2459,24 November 2024 at 05:58,"Left X after

2460,24 November 2024 at 00:18,LETS BE HONEST WE ALL LEFT X TWITTER BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION AND ELMOS HOUSE AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE FOR ME..” HOW ABOUT YOU 👈
2461,24 November 2024 at 16:56,I have left X. I have that luxury since I don't need or want followers. I hope that we can remove the relevance of Elon and his disinformation machine
2462,24 November 2024 at 15:52,I'm enjoying this harassment free site- I'm not here for arguing and definitely not here to be a MAGA's punching bag. I left X for that very thing.
2463,24 November 2024 at 16:03,I left X before it was given that name.
2464,24 November 2024 at 17:07,"I left ‘x’ because I didn’t like what it became. Enjoying Bluesky, but I’m still seeing ‘x’ posts! Ugh! Can we just stop reposting their crap? Pretty please? 🍒 on top"
2465,24 November 2024 at 16:23,What did I do? It's been less than 24 hours on here? Who TF made you Hall Monitor- oh snap you have the vest on. I see now. You left X to come here to become the word salad enforcer?
2466,24 November 2024 at 16:02,We left X in order never to see him again.
2467,24 November 2024 at 16:18,"Say what? I'm glad I left X. He's been giving out our PII (Personally Identifiable Information, like DOB, phone number, and email. and DMs from X to his white supremacist bros like Ivan Raiklin and Christian Nationalist Michael Flynn St."
2468,24 November 2024 at 19:09,I left X when it wiped all my follows and then recommended I follow Laurence Fox. I am so happy to be in a Musk free zone with some old friends and new. Hi everyone!
2469,24 November 2024 at 18:50,"I did the same type of thing when I left X/Twitter 11/7. 

Black ⚫️ profile pic & changed my background pic to crashed cybertruck + left a statement that I could not take all the harassment, hate, porn & scams on X anymore, so heading over to BlueSky 🦋"
2470,24 November 2024 at 18:57,Companies that left X. Elon Musk watching his fortune disappear.
2471,24 November 2024 at 18:48,"Are those your cats? SO PRECIOUS!!! 
YES, X is toxic; I left X but am concerned w/my 🇺🇦 friends. I am constantly purging my life from unnecessary items, toxic substances, habits, and people who I feel don't live in alignment with my values."
2472,24 November 2024 at 19:58,"Plenty on here that have left x for obvious reasons. Guys like you backing here huge, so please keep doing so, can only see it growing."
2473,24 November 2024 at 19:30,"I feel welcomed,

I remember traveling to a country in Europe, my taxi driver did not understand me, nor me him. We drove to an area in a metro city that reminded me of the remains of WW2. I felt so frightened, no terrified. I felt so very alone.
I left X wondering who would respond to me ever again"
2474,24 November 2024 at 20:55,It’s probably a desperate attempt to make up for ALL the people that has left X 🙌😂
2475,24 November 2024 at 21:28,"Left X yesterday after I got 6  join Truth Social adds in a row between every post. I was going to stay and fight, but it has become a complete fascist MAGA cesspool. I feel liberated! 💙"
2476,24 November 2024 at 20:18,I left X when the pirate captured the ship. Problem is how the pirate dominates conversation to the exclusion of almost everyone else. Purists might say why shouldn't billionaires join the conversation? Difference is joining a conversation versus shouting over everyone. Graceless and annoying.
2477,24 November 2024 at 18:51,I was thinking about something. We all sit here and I think a big majority of people have left X but it's seen as we can't handle things. When we just don't want to be a part. What I was thinking is just flipping what I have. Which is more like a beacon. The account will be a light for all things 1/
2478,24 November 2024 at 18:58,"I used to love Twitter!  I had so many famous friends, many who then left x in 2022.  I hope to gather everyone back up now."
2479,24 November 2024 at 22:10,Twitter is dead. I left “X”. May Bluesky thrive and Twitter to rise one day again.
2480,24 November 2024 at 22:10,"4. I am conservative, and I left X because I couldnt stand all the hatred there. It took few months to find Bluesky. But it feels good."
2481,24 November 2024 at 21:47,"People, if you left X so you wouldn't have to deal with that idiot Musk, why are you bringing up what that idiot says or does to Bluesky? He needs attention, and we're giving it to him."
2482,24 November 2024 at 21:38,I left X
2483,20 November 2024 at 18:50,I'm new to Blue Sky and I'm hoping to reconnect with my lovely reading/writing friends who left X and to make new connections with fellow readers and writers here. Any advice on how best to do this?
2484,20 November 2024 at 17:38,"I remember Mehdi, and so glad you're here on Blue Sky. I left X and MSNBC just in time to watch Joe and Mika go kiss Trumps ass at Mar a Lago,  then Trump shits all over them.😃"
2485,20 November 2024 at 17:31,"Hi Bluesky - Having left X I'm just starting here. Intertesterd in

2486,20 November 2024 at 17:14,So glad I left X/Twitter.
2487,20 November 2024 at 16:39,i left X the day after election.
2488,20 November 2024 at 16:31,This will be the most authoritarian Executive Branch administration but they can’t force compliance. The most effective tactic institutions and individuals will have these next four years is to not participate. That’s why I left X. Used to call it Twitter but it died and I was refusing to accept it.
2489,20 November 2024 at 15:17,"Hello!

I'm glad you're here & that I've found you here after I left X! 

I have found your information/posts fascinating, informative & thought provoking.

😊 I thank you for that! 💛"
2490,20 November 2024 at 15:15,"I left X and can't watch news either. Instead, I joined Bluesky and subscribed to the Atlantic, the Guardian, and the New Yorker."
2491,20 November 2024 at 15:59,"The reason people left X in the first place is it became overrun  with russian bots, hateful rhetoric and disinformation. People are free to use whatever platform they want to interact. Market competition is good.

Also, some of us just don’t want to see your BS on the timeline."
2492,25 November 2024 at 22:26,I left X.
2493,25 November 2024 at 21:40,"I had a great uncle I was close to taught me alot,He had a sayin don't beat up who's done you wrong get um where it hurts in the pocketbook everyone on here that hasnt left X yet do so now The more that completely leaves X the More it hurts Elon where he's got to sell and lose $ and we all want that"
2494,25 November 2024 at 21:44,"I left X bc it was bcming unsafe, and, I wanted a safe place 2 voice my opinions on political matters in such a way reflecting intelligent thought and reasoning.

2495,26 November 2024 at 00:48,"I am a blue dot in a Red State and just left X.
Let’s follow each other. We are stronger together"

2497,25 November 2024 at 22:55,thank god i left X
2498,25 November 2024 at 22:47,His talking points are almost verbatim Joe Rogan. He checks the boxes of a Joe Rogan listener. Saying “everyone on BlueSky” is certainly a misnomer.  Do you know why I left X?  Endless extreme right wing political ads that I blocked over and over.
2499,25 November 2024 at 22:06,I left X.
2500,25 November 2024 at 03:33,"My husband had 15,000 followers at X, but he left X

2505,25 November 2024 at 03:12,"Just left X after 4 years, could not take the censorship, the political MAGA focus. Did my best to tell Vice President Musk that I would not accept his advertisers and would never give him anything. I feel relieved  !"

2511,24 November 2024 at 01:22,Bluesky really needs to do better with verification. Saying “anyone can self verify” is not it. This is one of the biggest reasons people left X. If they want to retain users they’ve gotta fix this.

2523,25 November 2024 at 17:57,I left X right after the election. Musk has made it a platform for his hate and propaganda
2524,25 November 2024 at 13:49,I was a member of twitter now X for 20 years but left  X due to the disinformation environment. I am hoping to have a better experience here. Please join me!
2525,25 November 2024 at 15:46,"Yea sadly :c But there was two accs i was following on X dedicated to the anime, one was screen shots and one an artist who draw the characters but idk the name of their handles cuz i left X and deleted my acc :("
2526,25 November 2024 at 17:02,You left X because you cannot tolerate anyone who has a different perspective.  Keep living in your bubble.
2527,25 November 2024 at 17:26,"Sure seems to be a lot of posting of screenshots of Tweets from a lot of people who have said ""I'm never going back to X again""... just saying. 

Look, do they improve the community on Bluesky? Most of us left X to never have to see that garbage again. Does it NEED to be imported over?"
2528,25 November 2024 at 17:40,Glad I left X and Elonia.
2529,25 November 2024 at 20:21,Left X yesterday heard good things about this app🙏🏻
2530,25 November 2024 at 19:34,I haven’t left X just yet but the more posts I see from Elon the more I want to delete
2531,25 November 2024 at 01:51,"I left X shortly after E*lon took over and never looked back, relying on the 
@theguardian.com
 and other news outlets to stay informed. When I heard about Bluesky , I was definitely intrigued. The vibe here is definitely great but I ask myself, will having this community make a difference?"
2532,25 November 2024 at 08:47,"really. when those ""perspectives"" are wholly based in lies and propaganda? they will just go somewhere else without X anyway, at least they can be monitored on X, or pointed out for what it is by 'media', why would we want them here 🤔 💙 we left X because of them. 🤷‍♀️"
2533,25 November 2024 at 11:26,"Amen,I left x because of all the political bullshit, and it is disappointing to find it here. Many far left people butthurted. Why we don't just have a place to share nice things ?"
2534,25 November 2024 at 09:58,Glad I left X
2535,25 November 2024 at 07:25,"Wouldn't the hissy fit be those people who didn't get their way controlling free speech, then somehow lost an election to a felon who never should have even been able to run, so they up and left X to come here?"

2537,25 November 2024 at 12:57,"18 months ago I left X/twitter and stopped involvement in political things in Australia, but after seeing what's happened in the USA it's time to be involved again."
2538,25 November 2024 at 12:42,"I hope BlueSky will eventually get to where people like me, who create through video, can post longer videos than 60 seconds. That is a limitation that hinders messaging. I left X for the same reasons everyone did, but I hope we gain the functionality of that platform here. 
@support.bsky.team"
2539,25 November 2024 at 12:34,"One reason I was turned off by Threads was the endless posting of pictures (and stories) of Trump. I wasn't interested in his daily routine of insanity. Now I am starting to see endless pictures of Musk here.  I left X because I don't want to see or hear from him incessantly.  Moderation, please."
2540,25 November 2024 at 14:51,"This just reminds me, post election I am so ready to chuck old habits and conveniences. I left X, FB and now leaving Threads. Places w/ irresponsible management. I am now going to leave Spotify too."
2541,25 November 2024 at 14:47,"💜 I left X (shiver!), user name cindywindy_52. Looking to follow like minded people and friends I had on the late great twitter!"

2545,25 November 2024 at 16:42,"I like this a lot! Also left X, and totally over all that shit. Generally also not interested in online sex work. No I won't sub to your Onlyfans or whatever. I'm here for for fun, sex positive sharing. Not one sided commodification and revenue generation"
2546,24 November 2024 at 22:48,I was gonna delete mine but i've heard about right people taking the @'s of deleted accounts and doing sketchy shit with them so I just left x-x
2547,24 November 2024 at 22:59,That is exactly why I left X - and things already feel better!

 yay!!!!! I was so excited to see you here - I have been missing you since I left X after the alien bought it and ruined it!"
2551,26 November 2024 at 22:49,"Left X over a year ago and finally decided that Threads might not be enough or the right place for me so here I am once again trying a new platform. I see so many familiar names that I’ve missed while entrenched in Bookstagram bliss. I love the bliss, but also excited for the discourse again!"
2552,27 November 2024 at 01:43,"😂😂😂 No, because he didn't, dummy.😂😂😂

Is that why you left X?

There was too much truth for you?

Even Zuckerberg recently came out admitting that he complied too easily with Biden admin and law enforcement (FBI!) requests for censorship!

Learn the truth, before spewing more lies, dummy!"
2553,27 November 2024 at 01:14,"@theomoudakis.bsky.social
 So glad to reconnect with you, Theo! I left X a while ago, and you were a main reason I was there."

2555,26 November 2024 at 23:32,Finally left X after battling with myself over the last year about it. The election was the final straw for me. It became unbearable for me. Do not miss it in the slightest. Finding this site much better and also user friendly compared to threads
2556,27 November 2024 at 00:46,"I left X because of Musk, trolls & the RW nutbags, climate deniers, anti vaxers. 
Aussie here.
If I could have voted...definitely Kamala Harris."

Immer wieder vor! SC Freiburg vor!"
2560,26 November 2024 at 15:32,"Asked why I left X, my first thoughts were things like cesspool of racism, bots and Russian propaganda. After thinking about it, I think X is basically like an AI version of a person that would have a hyphenated name like, Donald-Marjorie-Bobart-Gaetz Miller-Vlad-Musk. How many more names would fit?"

2563,26 November 2024 at 10:43,"To all 
#bluesky
 citizens who left X because of toxicity there and think ""oh yeah, we start a new life here"":

Are you sure that Bluesky survives in its current form till the end of the next year? It is not a suitable point of time to rely on such illusions. Be prepared for the fight. Right now."
2564,26 November 2024 at 12:53,Do what makes it easier on you. Their are some folks who did left X 100% and some still hasn’t . So good engagement is always welcomed.
2565,26 November 2024 at 11:36,"I left X and hadn't been active there for quite a long time. I really missed writers who would post tips, articles, etc. I loved 
#writing
 hashtags and bursts of community. I am looking to find that here - if you or anyone you know are 
#writers
 who share this kind of content, please drop your handle!"

2567,26 November 2024 at 12:06,"I left X/twitter the day Elon bought it, so I’ve had some distance. Now on here I see some profiles that I used to follow and interact with over there, and I don’t want much to do with them. I think the constant and prolonged garbage over there broke some of them. It’s different here."
2568,26 November 2024 at 12:03,"I hear you CJ. I have a paid subscription for a year and it has been canceled. I will be deactivating them sooner or later. 

I can't help but wonder would things be different if we all had of left X when Elon took over?"
2569,26 November 2024 at 12:04,"This is why I left X.  Elon is tilting the playing field to ensure Trumps base doesn’t read the truth.

2571,26 November 2024 at 19:27,"I left X because of the proximity to such negative energy. But even here, I’m starting to see negativity just in the opposite direction. We don’t need to gang up on every non black person. It’s weird"
2572,26 November 2024 at 19:15,Totally left X.  Hit him where you can.  Blue Skies ahead!
2573,26 November 2024 at 19:24,"Sorry JoJo. I cannot follow you any more. Your hate and venom (toward MAGA and anyone else with whom you disagree) is too much like what I left X to get away from, but from a left perspective. Hate is hate. Poison is poison."
2574,26 November 2024 at 03:58,Has everyone who is here left X or are you still on there?
2575,26 November 2024 at 11:09,This app doesn’t even have hashtags or anyone cool here just a buncha Democrat funded accounts from twitter to grift followers and engagement here. Their contracts are up. So they’ll make it look like they left X by choice. They’ll all slowly stop posting here. I guarantee it. Saw it in 2016 too
2576,26 November 2024 at 13:14,"You took a lot of hate with you when you left X.

I can't wait until you leave the public eye."

2582,26 November 2024 at 18:34,Delighted to see you here. Have you completely left X yet?
2583,26 November 2024 at 19:02,Which is why you left X.  To have your own echochamber of emotions.
2584,26 November 2024 at 18:11,I left X for a reason and I don’t need to see his face any longer.  Thank you.
2585,26 November 2024 at 16:52,"www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-panel... with critical thinking skills have left X, which is nothing more than a propaganda arm of Maga"
2586,26 November 2024 at 16:09,He's currently spreading right wing lies about my country. Undermining democracy and fermenting unrest. He algorithmed himself. Glad I left X
2587,26 November 2024 at 15:29,I left X and just joined Bluesky. I don’t support propaganda machines X or Truth Social. I’d love to see X go bankrupt.
2588,27 November 2024 at 05:53,"Well I have left X once and for all, all my accounts old and new are deactivated. I feel cleaner!!!"
2589,26 November 2024 at 20:21,Or and here me out here there actually being respectful as all of the hateful people have left X and joined this one.
2590,26 November 2024 at 22:07,"Why I Left X : 
Coz I can and it’s a freedom of choice"
2591,29 November 2024 at 01:04,This site needs to step up on-sight banning MAGA accounts. There’s not going to be any long term adoption if the entire reason that people left X just illegally immigrates in a caravan (lol) to bluesky.
2592,29 November 2024 at 00:18,I left X right after Elon bought it. I’m patient. Good things come to those that wait.
2593,29 November 2024 at 00:07,"I am tired of Trump, that’s why I left X. Why do we have to bring his Bs here, too."
2594,28 November 2024 at 22:37,"Unbelievable tweet by Elon Musk. ""Adam Mockler with MeidasTouch Network breaks down Donald Trump's stooge Elon Musk getting a reality check from veteran Alexander S. Vindman.""

2595,29 November 2024 at 03:00,Oh Im sure you could. Im not going to play into your game. I left X because I didnt want to deal with people like you. Your side supposedly won and your still angry chasing us Libs from app to app to get rises. That stops here.
2596,29 November 2024 at 02:46,"I am thrilled. I left X too. Musk destroyed its content, validity  and integrity. It's Musks' personal bully pulpit.  Twitter's board was a total disgrace to sell it to him."
2597,29 November 2024 at 04:03,Sorry I left X because of bots and am looking to engage and have differences of opinion here in good faith.
2598,29 November 2024 at 04:01,"Thats why I left X & 100% what I'm looking to do here. And I hope that prevails on Bluesky for most ppl but people who actually don't want that, and are quick to block are free to do so, and fair enough if they aren't looking to use the app for discussion/debate"
2599,29 November 2024 at 06:52,When I left X I blocked Elon but as soon as I did I saw his post !! He has it so he can't be blocked !! what a Tool.
2600,29 November 2024 at 13:53,"I left X after Trump was banished; I was only there to try to get him to block me, but I wasn’t important enough to the flunkies who monitored it for him. I left Threads after a MAGAat invasion. LOVE BlueSky!💙"
2601,28 November 2024 at 02:51,Elmo is really going to lose his shit when he looks around and realizes he's surrounded by flat earthers and morons since everyone else left X.
2602,28 November 2024 at 06:34,Left X weeks ago. Saying hello here. Happy Thanksgiving 🦃🙏🏼❤️ And words from Maya.
2603,28 November 2024 at 01:32,"Oh I'm blocking. We don't want this sort of thing here, it's what we left X to get away from."
2604,28 November 2024 at 21:09,The real reason you left X is not because of nazis. We know liberals support Nazis in Ukraine. It's because you have ridiculously dumb ideas that aren't rooted in common sense and you don't want your dumb ideas being challenged.
2605,22 November 2024 at 12:06,I like to imagine the 21+million Bluesky users have all left X. Makes me smile.😊
2606,22 November 2024 at 11:16,"Enjoyed your work since I was a trecky kid...
Enjoyed your presence on X...
Since I've left X, I am happy I can continue to enjoy your presence on Bsky!"
2607,22 November 2024 at 12:23,They are mad that we left X. And they’re mad that we refuse to engage with them. I don’t know why they need us to watch them be bigots.
2608,22 November 2024 at 13:40,This is why we all left X behind.
2609,22 November 2024 at 14:28,I followed you on X.  Then I left X.  I'm glad I found you again here. :)
2610,22 November 2024 at 15:03,We really need to look at a viable 3rd party and leave the democrats like we left X (twitter)

2614,22 November 2024 at 14:01,"We hope it continues this way. We have reached a point in this country where there is a division of ethics and I don’t want to surround myself with hate. I left X, when it became X."
2615,22 November 2024 at 13:05,"Left X for obvious reasons. Still deciding between bluesky and threads.

Damn, I miss twitter from when it was still called twitter."
2616,22 November 2024 at 13:06,"I would be fascinated to read two of your pieces in particular (why people are afraid to ask HCWs to mask, and the importance of mandates), but I only see links to X. Is there anywhere else to read these? (I've left X.)"
2617,22 November 2024 at 13:23,"Starting to see the so-called “moderates” saying this place might turn into an echo-chamber.

Remember why folks left X in the first place.

You do not have to listen to someone who actively attacks your humanity or the humanity of other oppressed groups. Point blank period.

Nonprofits often use Twitter/X to reach policymakers, journalists, funders and other organisations working on the same issue.
 
Look through your stakeholder influence map and see who has stayed on X, left X, set up on BlueSky etc and adjust your map and comms strategy.

2790,6 December 2024 at 18:28,"Dude, inserting yourself into a convo, just to be an ass....isn't a mark of courage. Its just being the reason most of us left X. Not from cowardice. But realizing arguing with strangers makes no sense."

2792,6 December 2024 at 19:52,I hear you. And I was wrong. It appears there isn’t a way to actually block them it just hides the images. I left X after the election and then started this account. I was happy to find you here.
2793,6 December 2024 at 19:12,YOU Left X? I Guess the dem party electioneering finally got to you. Nobody cares if they are the same or not. Democrats are all brain damaged.
2794,6 December 2024 at 19:13,"Wow, take it easy dude! I meant this to the people criticizing republicans, they same way they were criticized on X. They are showing that they are the same as what they criticize and left X for. They are supposed to have the high ground. I guess there is no room for the middle in Bluesky either. 😳🤣"
2795,6 December 2024 at 19:28,I left X for this platform. Not fond of Musk or his political crap. I plan to invite my contacts here as well when I learn more how to use it.

2798,7 December 2024 at 05:02,Also recently left x. Really like LinkedIn for my professional life but have noticed a bit of politics and intolerance creeping in recently. Been here on Blue Sky for a couple of weeks with a professional and a private account and love it. Hope it stays like this but fear trolls will follow.
2799,7 December 2024 at 05:12,This is the reason I left X. I hope this experiment that is BlueSky is successful.

2810,4 December 2024 at 15:52,I think you’re just mad because all of the leftwing bots left x once Elon made them start paying to post stuff.  You guys also believe that someone who “doesn’t agree” is the worst voice…this is why Repubs won convincingly last month

2832,1 December 2024 at 01:36,"Better still, another million have left X."
2833,1 December 2024 at 04:00,"I don't.   Basically I read it as a history of the decline of our Media, I watched Biden try to get the Media to do its job.  We need to stop subscribing to them.  Like we left X."

Very few.  Very, very few."

3065,19 October 2024 at 18:20,I think for most people bsky was a better drop in replacement for Twitter. The UI is pretty similar and you often get people say bsky feels like old Twitter. I started using bsky to follow people who left X and they tried Mastodon first but the community over there wasn't for them
3066,27 October 2024 at 21:24,Yes we have arrived.  We left X and are waiting here or on Threads.

This right here is why I am glad I left X. 
Firewalk was shut down. People lost their jobs and something they had put in blood, sweat, and tears over the past 8 years was shuttered. 

Instead of showing human compassion...
People chose to just shit all over the post. 

W.T.F?"

3073,25 October 2024 at 14:17,Most of them don't want to lose their followers and some get no interaction here. But if everyone came over here and left X it would better for following and interactions since there is no algorithm or shadowbans.

But generally it’s also worth considering that it’s not only what people are here FOR. It’s also what they are escaping FROM. 

X has gotten worse in quite a few ways recently."
3200,15 November 2024 at 14:10,Love that you’re on here!! Left X and was worried I’d miss your posts.

3218,15 November 2024 at 12:19,"I wonder what is the Number of people that have left X already? And, how many is leaving daily? Elon and Trump and their MAGA Cult can have that $44Billion piece of garbage floating around spewing lies and deception."
3219,15 November 2024 at 11:52,I left X precisely because it had divided ‘right’ and ‘left’ users (it decided who was who) and then actively promoted the views of the right and undermined the views of users it regarded as the left.
3220,15 November 2024 at 12:09,"I left X (such a stupid name), like I’m sure practically everyone else did, because Elon ruined the platform. Sick of constantly reporting/blocking bot accounts, sick of the constant disinformation/lies. It was never about abandoning the fight. Bluesky is a breath of fresh air."

3339,13 November 2024 at 23:28,Who wants to join the resistance? Let's connect and follow each other specially if you left X (the swamp) to come here for a fresh start!

3342,14 November 2024 at 02:12,TBH I stopped watching the news. Left X. I just can't right now.
3343,13 November 2024 at 23:53,"I just left X. It's gotten more and more toxic in the past years or so. I think Musk is a lunatic, one who wants a dangerous amount of power and he's got magats convinced he's the second coming.  They think he's a hero who saved 'free speech'. I think he's a dangerous creep."
3344,13 November 2024 at 23:45,Left X to come here and find out its X without Republicans!

I bailed on Twitter over a year ago — I could see the signs. Bluesky wasn’t very popular at the beginning so I landed on Threads. Might start posting here now that ppl have finally left X!"

I had up to 12K at one point on X  ... mostly used it for reality TV trends ...but the engagement was Z-E-R-O these past cpl yrs"

3403,15 November 2024 at 19:34,One of the biggest reasons I left X/Twitter and closed my account last night was freaky Elon Musk’s new terms and conditions policy enabling him to use our information and photos to create AI avatars of us for whatever purposes he wishes in the future. That was the last straw for me.

3411,15 November 2024 at 20:54,"The international break is definitely helping. No tribalism to cause arguments between fans/with journos. However also a lot of the users and fans who’ve left X weren’t the ones interested in the arguing etc anyway, so it makes here more reasonable."

3438,19 November 2024 at 20:41,I joined because many have left X and FB is not doing anything about hackers taking peoples accounts. Will this platform do better? Curious for those who’ve been on here since start up.
3439,19 November 2024 at 17:58,This is the kind of empty calorie crap I left X to avoid.

3443,19 November 2024 at 21:46,What’s Elon’s plan when Trump breaks up with him and he realises everyone’s left X ?
3444,19 November 2024 at 21:04,I left X long ago and just joined Bluesky today. I gave Mastodon a long chance first and then couldn't find any reason to hold out any longer with the recent momentum and all the improvements to this platform.

3454,17 November 2024 at 19:19,I searched for ‘first post’ before using the filter. Cringe. Is there a filter for ‘no adult content please?’ Don’t want to see that shit first thing. This was one of the reasons I left X. Anyone?
3455,17 November 2024 at 19:39,"I keep this photo as a reminder of why I left X/Twitter.  The bots.  Oh, the flippin' bots.  And that's not an image you want coming up on your watch.  People will start talking."

3491,18 November 2024 at 05:31,"I'm not going to feel frustrated but as a Kamala supporter who left X due to Trump and Elon's influence, it's annoying to see Trump supporters following us here. I thought we'd found a safe space to share our thoughts and ideas, but now I'm seeing the same divisive rhetoric and personal attacks."
3492,18 November 2024 at 06:46,"Last year, when many left X, the genealogy community was scattered. If I look at the number of followers and interactions, some platforms just aren’t worth spending time on. That is, for me. May be different for others."
3493,18 November 2024 at 04:51,"No, I'm right. Everyone else who left X feels the same way. If you don't, go back there. We won't miss you. We promise."

3505,17 November 2024 at 14:06,I’d just like to stress if you left X because it’s poisoned leave your mark by putting your handle on X as a parting shot.
3506,17 November 2024 at 12:58,Left x who doesn't like a blue sky.

3508,17 November 2024 at 13:24,I left x after it was sold because I already knew that the new owner is a bloviating incel who had bad intent. I am on threads and now here. My goal is to absorb the suffering of the upcoming regime and offer zero support to those that elected the small dictator.

Hello👋
This is my first post. I've been here since yesterday.
I left X because 
@barbrastreisand.bsky.social
 also moved. I became interested in social media because of her, but to my surprise I met many other great people with passion.
I hope to find each other here as well🙂 
Today marks 41 years"
3510,17 November 2024 at 16:23,"True blue.
Left X a year ago. Went to threads but never got much of a following. Liking what I’m seeing here. When trolls appear, I’m going to try, try, try to block rather than engage. The struggle is real. Followed the newest batch on here and will come back each day to get more. Thank you!"
3511,17 November 2024 at 16:10,"Nooooooooo. 

I sent Thelma a message before I left ‘X’ wondering what was up as her account went silent. 

I thought her account was being throttled. 

This breaks my heart too. 

She was so witty.

💔"

3515,17 November 2024 at 16:51,"I’m struggling with this whole concept. I left X when Musk took over. I just joined this app and since the election, I’m not talking with my Trumper family. I am now in an echo chamber of my own making and I don’t know how to feel about it. Can we ever come together?"
3516,17 November 2024 at 16:02,I just left X bc it has gotten ridiculous
3517,17 November 2024 at 17:46,I can’t be positive this is real because I left X but if it is he is absolutely nuts. If anyone can confirm let me know!
3518,17 November 2024 at 17:47,So now its acceptable? Tell that to everyone that left X to come here for because they couldnt get used to it and because it wasnt their corner. Lol

Just saying it’s feeling like home…even the similarity of my clinic’s logo and Bsky☺️"
3523,18 November 2024 at 11:19,As soon as I left X I got a message from @musk - his 'personal page' reminding me about my free Tesla. This illustrates why I left.
3524,21 November 2024 at 04:28,So glad I found you again. I left X and couldn't find you on Threads but here you are and it's like reuniting with a long list friend. Thank you for all you do Stevie Joe ❤️!

3537,21 November 2024 at 05:58,"Ron. You are right!  I see them more and more popping up on this platform because they want to bring toxicity and get revenge on all who left X.

They live to burn things down… they don’t want anyone to have peace!"
3538,21 November 2024 at 04:14,I left X shortly after Muskrat took over. I checked a few other places after and wasn't feeling them. Found here about a week ago and it fits like a glove. Seeing so many people i used to follow on X here now. 💙
3539,21 November 2024 at 04:42,"It is one of the reasons I haven’t left X entirely. Want to be able to see what they are saying, to keep informed. I don’t have that many followers there. They mostly leave me alone. Would like to have more followers here."

3548,17 November 2024 at 04:17,Is there a way on here to block all tweets pertaining to American politics. The constant barrage of it is a big reason I left X and hoped I wouldn’t see it everywhere on here yet here it is!
3549,17 November 2024 at 04:18,I just signed up here too. When I left X it was already a toxic waste dump. It’s only gotten worse since.

3634,20 November 2024 at 11:00,"Not much on media 
I have a time slots 
A bit in the morning..then another one after dinner, checking at random...
Left X because is just a reason for depression and high blood pressure illnesses...and not much apart from food recipes or cats and dogs..."
3635,20 November 2024 at 09:02,This feels… different. Pretty sure I left X for the same reason most of y’all did. Let’s see what this place is about.😬
3636,20 November 2024 at 09:44,"I left X long ago, I think many did but was told to go back and delete my page"
3637,20 November 2024 at 09:45,I joined Bluesky with an invite but only became active when the lawyers Journalist and majority of friends left X…the bird was great for breaking news is one of the reasons I stayed..now it’s happening here.

! I love that we all left X so we could come here to our own echo chamber!"
3640,17 November 2024 at 01:59,I found this site a few weeks ago. I am not one of the many who left x I haven't had it since it was early twitter. I was happy because the interests I chose gave me nice people who talked about pretty much everything but politics. I just want one place I can go where it doesn't follow me.
3641,15 November 2024 at 22:54,Your posts were the only things I missed when I left X.  I am so happy you are here!
3642,15 November 2024 at 23:10,I’m free!!! I left x-hole today and deactivated my account.  Feels oh so good.

3669,16 November 2024 at 16:54,"Yes, have YOU left X yet? You should take a stand and announce a complete move off X and Insta because Meta is no better! Please practice what you preach."
3670,16 November 2024 at 12:53,A lot of people seem to skate over the ethical consumer dimension. I left X principally because it's owned by Musk. I stopped buying the Times during the Wapping lockout - haven't paid for a copy since. Might if Murdoch ever sells it. I don't buy from Amazon (tax). I will never own a Tesla.

3673,16 November 2024 at 18:09,I left X it is one of the biggest sources of misinformation since he bought it and full of hateful followers
3674,16 November 2024 at 18:23,Exactly! I have a feeling it's a lot of random accounts being made. Probably coming from X. Good to see you here! I lost contact with so many when I left X awhile ago!
3675,16 November 2024 at 18:42,Hello bsky! Left X as soon as it changed hands. Happy to be here.
3676,16 November 2024 at 19:22,"@earthmamamayhem.bsky.social
 I left X officially Wednesday night and went to here shortly after. Seems this week was a breaking point for lots of people."
3677,16 November 2024 at 16:13,Fact check Elon Musk’s social platform is an all-time high so you people who left X fuck you you’ll be back. but that’s what happens when you’re back a retard can’t speak two sentences and says she’s black and she’s not liars. Liars always get caught and the Democrats got caught lying.
3678,16 November 2024 at 16:18,I’ll be using blue sky as well as ex it’s nice to see with all the haters and crybabies who left X because the dumbass was running for president lost the real president one he’s gonna make America great again So all you losers and haters transgender get used to it h he’s here to stay

3686,16 November 2024 at 17:03,I left X. My account is still active (I don't post there anymore) for when muck goes off to poison something else.
3687,16 November 2024 at 15:28,"I left X months ago but have been hesitant to join another social media platform. With FB blocking news in Canada, though, and the recent influx of new users, I thought I would give this a go."
3688,16 November 2024 at 17:58,Well I just left x.  This is First post here!
3689,18 November 2024 at 12:07,Give it time. I just left X after being a user since what... 2009? It'll grow in good time. Just be thankful we're one of the first inhabitants of the app lol
3690,18 November 2024 at 12:16,Yeah.....it'll take them time to figure it out.   Right now they think we left X to lick our wounds and die like a dog.  😆
3691,18 November 2024 at 21:11,Left X. Retreat to regroup. That space has hit rock bottom
3692,18 November 2024 at 21:02,I left X because I couldn't say F@GG0T
3693,18 November 2024 at 15:40,Says the ❄️ who left X because of the people being “mean.”   Good example.
3694,18 November 2024 at 15:46,"A little mantra for all of us here on BlueSky who left X:

Those who hated you there never hated you, they only hated themselves and transferred it to you. They will try again here.

You have no obligation to interact with them here. Use starter packs to block liberally and often."

3698,18 November 2024 at 14:55,"I’ve not joined this app for political reasons. I joined for a couple of reasons 

1: X has too many adverts even if you pay for premium (which you have to if you want to stream live content)

2: To make sure I am able to share the show on here 

3: to maintain connection with many who have left X"

3769,19 November 2024 at 03:01,Im not the person finding random people on a app I don’t like to troll online and try to start an argument? I don’t find any joy in that. That why I left X as I don’t get the point of trying to annoy or anger random people anymore. Don’t get the point or find it fun/ fulfilling.
3770,19 November 2024 at 02:08,People left X because people were telling them no one gives a shit about Truth social and we should make this place what we want it to be and not care about what other people say?  Because that is quite literally what my reply was.  Who cares about an echo chamber.  Do what makes you happy.
3771,19 November 2024 at 02:45,I left X to get away from Russian bots like Gunther.
3772,19 November 2024 at 03:20,I left X but have joined you here
3773,19 November 2024 at 01:47,"This is part of it, but liberals should have left X en masse a long time ago; DJT winning the election was the first thing to dent their reality enough to, at least temporally, leave their followers and break their addiction

3774,19 November 2024 at 01:15,"I fully left X tonite, not real sure why it took me so long. 🤷‍♂️"

Must of Left X ??

Can't Stand the Heat..."
3778,22 November 2024 at 03:58,"Hello Glenn, I'm delighted to find you here at Blue Sky. I left X Twitter today So I am an X from X."
3779,24 November 2024 at 10:30,Finally left X for good.
3780,24 November 2024 at 09:45,Having left X what I miss is the opportunity to sound off on a Sunday morning about how annoying Laura Kuenssberg is ? Do the equivalent channels for moaning exist on Bluesky ?
3781,23 November 2024 at 19:58,Coincidentally left X the same day you did. Watch the Trump/Musk saga play out like all the rest…..anyone who goes near him gets burned ….bad!  Musk will live to regret it!
3782,23 November 2024 at 22:34,So left X months ago.  Successfully off of FB for almost 3 weeks.  Hoping this place works out better.  I’m rooting for us.
3783,24 November 2024 at 11:58,"We should not attempt to create an echo chamber, the main issue why people left X is their unwillingness to moderate hate speech and conspiracy theories. Right wingers should be allowed into Bluesky to fulfill its role as a real public square, provided they engage with others with respect."
3784,24 November 2024 at 10:57,Me too. That’s why I left X & deactivated my acct.
3785,24 November 2024 at 14:07,Ah. I see lol. Sorry I'm blind I need glasses. Well I finally left X but haven't closed the account b/c I still like to observe what Musk and his groonies are up to. It's become a cesspool of misinformation and white nationalist propaganda
3786,24 November 2024 at 13:18,I can’t relate to all the “I just left X” comments because I was banned from Twitter about 5 years ago. It had something to do with Laura Ingraham. 😅
3787,24 November 2024 at 14:26,"The cult of hate are abusers, it's in their DNA to be that way.  Which is why so many people left X."
3788,24 November 2024 at 21:25,The pedo part is true. Ever since the left X and went over to bluesky pedophilia went 50%
3789,24 November 2024 at 21:02,Welcome Home! (I added you to the OG bloggers starter pack. Lmk who I missed. So good to see your face. I left x and my Obama mutualship 😭 soon after the nazification began over there. I’m happy to have found the old gang. I wish RageBoy were here. Be well Kevin!
3790,24 November 2024 at 19:22,There are screwballs on this platform that proffer the same division that we left X for. Just mute or block him. His only satisfaction is making us angry.
3791,24 November 2024 at 20:06,"Left X a couple of weeks ago, and it feels SO GOOD ‼️‼️‼️"
3792,24 November 2024 at 18:06,"I just came here cuz I left ""X"" I'm proud of myself"
3793,24 November 2024 at 18:14,I left X long ago for a simple reason. I had no followers. My opinions make people mad. So now I just post drawings.
3794,24 November 2024 at 18:16,"No doubt about it.  What was it?  Oh yeah 
#ElonPornPicks

Because of art and music a lot of younger folks end up in my Discover feed and I've not seen any mention. Whereas before I left x it was at least once a week there'd be a warning about someone.
3801,28 November 2024 at 19:13,"I enjoyed your comment.  You are just the kind of person that were so pleased left X.  So tired of haters.  Enjoy your time in the cesspool, er Bluesky.   LOL."
3802,28 November 2024 at 23:08,"What I don’t get is why bring this content here, to us? People left X exactly to avoid that kind of content. I like you George, but why? Who cares about a person who’s a walking neurosis? Let him be whatever he thinks others fear but let him be that back in X."
3803,28 November 2024 at 22:32,"Lordy you are ignorant.
Which is why people left X -- cuz too many of ya were all ignorant, crude, rude, impolite whose goal was only to ""own the libs.""
Hunny, if you need to own the libs, then the libs are living rent free in your mind. Suffer."
3804,28 November 2024 at 22:58,You’re on here. Thank Christ. We’ve all left X. Hope Guernsey isn’t disappointing
3805,27 November 2024 at 16:36,Happy you left “X.” I decamped a while  ago myself and missed your posts!
3806,27 November 2024 at 15:55,"Thanks for the Jack Pack! I’m probably insane, but certifiably Not a psychopath. I left X when M took over Twitter."
3807,27 November 2024 at 11:58,I left  X day after election. No regrets at all. X was toxic since Musk bought it. Much calmer now.
3808,27 November 2024 at 17:14,"😊 Yay! Found you AND your project. Awesome!👍
Following both!

Glad you & your project are both on Bluesky now. 
I had followed both back on X & was missing the posts since I left X.

Keep up with your important work. You & it are so needed 💛"
3809,27 November 2024 at 17:19,Finally I left X. I feel great to be here.

3811,28 November 2024 at 07:25,I left X because of that shit being forced onto my posts there you think I'm just gonna let you use my bsky posts BE SO FR LMAO
3812,28 November 2024 at 11:32,"But, why be here if it's a well known place for liberals? I wouldn't say the memes y'all post are exactly the kind encouraging intelligent discussions. Seems like a lot of poking fun at people who don't align with MAGA opinions is what we see. That's why most of us left X."
3813,27 November 2024 at 20:23,I’m thankful to have left X.
3814,27 November 2024 at 21:01,Left X with a bang.
3815,20 November 2024 at 18:57,"lol so why all the X trolls coming over here to try to mess with all of us, eh? We left X! It’s now YOUR platform to do all your Nazi stuff without opposition. But nahhhh they gotta bring their attention- wh*ring arses over here"

3819,27 November 2024 at 18:45,Maga psychology: They are hate addicts. If they are fed truth they push back with lies their maga brains get a dopamine hit like a drug addict. They keep doing this and now that people with brains left x they look for it in other ways. All because it feeds the addiction.
3820,27 November 2024 at 22:01,Read the TOS princess. Free speech doesn't exist on social media. It never has and never will. Why you think all the main advertisers left X.... BRAND SECURITY
3821,27 November 2024 at 18:27,"Bluesky is decent, some parts of it are better than X. It’s fun

But the ‘exodus’ just making some people feel important. It’s up to 3.5m from 1m of which I’d imagine a chunk are not liberal and are fake or bot. So maybe 2m liberals have left X with some retaining accounts on X. 
X is 250m daily"

Odd you would still be stalking people on there."
3826,24 November 2024 at 02:59,"That “for you” feed on X was 90% right wing misinformation last few months

Hitting “show less of this” changed nothing

You can be assured this is Musk’s doing

I know many organizations now that have entirely left X over having their content next to vile hate content"
3827,24 November 2024 at 02:48,Just left X! On the mass exodus train… Here I am let’s be joyful and educated

3832,24 November 2024 at 18:59,"Memes like this are an Elon Musk specialty - why I left X:

- Don't contribute to discussion.
- Trigger emotions that stop rational thought.
- Trivialize complex issues.

Musk is a flawed, neurodivergent genius. He does much good and much harm - whether this balances out depends on your priorities."
3833,24 November 2024 at 18:26,This article will hit very close to home for all of us who have recently left “X” behind.  The impact of that exodus is happening live!  And it feels wonderful.  🧘🏾❤️🇺🇸The Right Has a Bluesky Problem - The Atlantic
3834,25 November 2024 at 01:42,"The bias in X is crystal clear especially since Musk allied with Trump this summer. Why are Democrats and the left still on X? It is no different than Truth Social which no one other than Newsom joined. If everyone left X would lose its value and pretense to being the ""town square."""

3841,25 November 2024 at 03:51,I'm conservative and don't mind this platform. I left X because it has a paywall that stops you from letting your voice and views out. The blue check means nothing now.
3842,25 November 2024 at 06:33,I don't keep up to date on it. It's too scary. One of the reasons I left X.

I had a long history on the site, met many friends there and had great memories, but I could no longer stay on there under the new ownership and the changes made.  I’m sad I don’t at least have a real archive of my time there (I did request one but never got it)."
3854,26 November 2024 at 23:11,I left X permanently. Closed my account. Bluesky all the way.

3874,24 November 2024 at 22:05,"I guess it wasn't really planned.

Feel free to mock the idiocy without the screenshot, but many of us don't want hate in our timelines, even with the intent to mock it."
3887,25 November 2024 at 15:10,Yeah. This kind of content is part of the reason so many people left X. No way I'm gonna sit back and watch while they work to destroy what we have here.

I left X because there was some fuckup with the login and every time I tried to get my account back it wouldn’t let me. Plus I’m in a country where X is banned."
3897,26 November 2024 at 05:19,I'm not on X anymore but if anyone else is and is a follower of Armand Hamouth please tell him to come over here. I hope he is ok. He was in ill health when I left x and I'm worried about him.  He was very active on x and had many followers.

3899,26 November 2024 at 05:08,Did you left X?
3900,26 November 2024 at 03:10,"All they want to do is rowl us civilized people up with their nonsense.  Since we have left X, they have nothing to do but argue and complain amongst themselves.  I like enjoying my peace, and not being fed conspiracies and lies.  David, I thank you for all of your insightful videos."
3901,26 November 2024 at 21:30,I am brand new here! I left X long long ago.
3902,9 November 2024 at 03:10,Left X because you couldn't handle opinions other than your own? Do you still believe this?
3903,25 November 2024 at 16:44,Left X because you couldn't handle opinions other than your own? Do you still believe this?
3904,25 November 2024 at 17:27,"I actually left X (twitter died, it’s X) over a year ago as Elon Musk is a transphobic and dangerous person. I won’t validate a platform that exists to put money in his pocket as he is the sole private owner.

Bluesky is the closest thing functionality wise, atmosphere has been fun & carefree."
3905,25 November 2024 at 17:58,"Off to a good start, already 3 million artist have left X..."
3906,25 November 2024 at 18:14,"I left X. Nowadays , it’s like reading the Der Stürmer or the The Völkischer Beobachter circa 1944 or Pravda when the USSR was still around. There’s nothing left there for me."
3907,25 November 2024 at 18:21,Just left X to join Blu sky  where I hope to find all the good journalists and reporters . and not have to deal with  MAGAS.
3908,25 November 2024 at 18:14,I left x because of him..cannot stand musk at all..but this is odd from him seeing as he disowned his trans kid
3909,25 November 2024 at 18:23,"If you’re going to be on Bluesky, make your vid uploads available on Bluesky. We left X for a reason!"
3910,25 November 2024 at 20:49,I'm just starting. I'm not sure if any of the platforms available do much in the way of interaction. I'll wait and see since so many have left X.
3911,25 November 2024 at 19:44,"I left X too because they were so mean to
us there.  They won’t even ban the MAGA people there.  I prefer my media to be devoid of all criticism against my views."
3912,25 November 2024 at 19:38,Wow he really posted that? Glad I left X. It’s like we elected the bottom of the barrel.
3913,26 November 2024 at 10:13,Woke up to a reminder why we all left X 🙄 (or at least stopped engaging)
3914,26 November 2024 at 11:52,Good grief I thought we left X to get away from Trump shit.
3915,26 November 2024 at 07:58,Thank you for making the effort for those of us who’ve left X!
3916,26 November 2024 at 10:47,"You left X for an echo chamber?

I left X because an echo chamber of hate."

3918,26 November 2024 at 06:15,"I had not left X ,cuz I had no where to go..i saw an interview with the FEMALE , toung, Bluesky CEO and LEFT immediately to Bluesky."
3919,26 November 2024 at 15:19,Left x found you here👍
3920,26 November 2024 at 16:26,"Here from your Off-JaWagon YT comment. Same, I left X awhile ago and came here lickety-split to boost and get to play a cathartic pass time of 'Wack-a-Troll' trying to stalk us here 🥊🧟‍♂️"
3921,26 November 2024 at 16:50,Good morning! So glad to have finally found you again! I missed you Carol and BlackKnight when I left X
3922,27 November 2024 at 12:28,New here. Left X. So far I like what I see.🙂
3923,27 November 2024 at 11:57,"If Bluesky continues to stay informative, neutral, friendly and newsworthy I would be willing to pay something for access (unlike X). I left ""X"" because I was getting nothing of value from it anymore. I could use my former subscription $ to 
@washingtonpost.com
 to pay for Bluesky."
3924,27 November 2024 at 15:28,Yall im not here for your political bullshit. It’s why I left x among other reasons. You post about it non stop I’ll just block you. Feel free to post what you like. I’m not here for it
3925,27 November 2024 at 15:32,"Since you, like me, probably left X because of the megaloegomaniac owner, this is the only post you'll see here of/about him from me. I've been trolling him like crazy but I'm just tired of him. And that's why I'm here."
3926,20 November 2024 at 14:33,Actually I think we are happy you liberals left X. Sure has been a better place since you left.
3927,20 November 2024 at 14:48,"This is why they left X and came here.

To avoid people like you trashing their worldview and shoving their hypocrisy down their throat.

Well done, friend."
3928,20 November 2024 at 15:33,"Good morning! I've left X and I'm starting anew here.
I'm excited and motivated to interact with like-minded Americans."
3929,20 November 2024 at 15:44,Have you left x permanently?
3930,20 November 2024 at 13:33,"They are angry because we left X and they have no one to make miserable, we like they are when realizing what failures they are in life!"

3934,20 November 2024 at 17:44,I left X I was only following Stephen king and John Carpenter so here I am🥰
3935,20 November 2024 at 18:41,"Before I left X, I wondered if that was an engagement tactic since some accounts had such similar descriptions of parents/kids dying. Disgusting if true to prey upon’s people better instincts and humanity to keep your app afloat."
3936,20 November 2024 at 21:00,Left X today.

3944,20 November 2024 at 21:07,"To be honest, I just left X to join Blue Sky because I dont want to be a part of the fascist movement of Trump/Musk."
3945,20 November 2024 at 12:39,I thought I escaped when I left X 🤣
3946,20 November 2024 at 13:14,I haven’t been called a Marxist since I left x.  Memories.  🤣
3947,20 November 2024 at 16:07,Good we don’t want that kind of hatred here! That’s why we left X
3948,20 November 2024 at 16:21,"Maga just wants to hold the keys to the town square. 

I left X to hear facts and truth, I hope Bluesky sticks around.

We need real news and not a Maga echo chamber."
3949,20 November 2024 at 13:13,Actually bluesky is mostly far left trolls that left X in search of echo chamber.
3950,20 November 2024 at 14:43,This is my favourite chapter of PhD. It joins the photosynthesis traits dataset (Asat) with biometric GPP dataset using a photosynthesis model! Sorry this is my first post on Bluesky (just left X) and not sure how to write # and @. But the professor said: at least used the magic emoji 🧪🧪🧪

3953,20 November 2024 at 13:25,"Yes, I know. I got the impression when I last messaged him that he is considering moving over. I haven't left X yet but will once I've got a better handle on this. Growing quickly so will hopefully only get better."

3956,22 November 2024 at 12:53,So glad I left x. Blue sky is better
3957,22 November 2024 at 13:00,Yet they wonder why people left X in droves. Bsky is successful right now because people got sick of being manipulated and lied to and wanted a place to exchange ideas without being derided by a million bots. The tech bros created a Frankenstein with their manipulating.
3958,22 November 2024 at 13:33,"People on X: if you dont like it, then leave!

People that left X for Bluesky: Yay, this is nice

People on X: hold up.."
3959,22 November 2024 at 14:28,I blocked some of them. And will keep some of them just to watch them crying over being snowflakes that we left X😅😂
3960,22 November 2024 at 14:31,Hi! Left X and trying this out!
3961,22 November 2024 at 14:24,What's up Bluesky?  I just left X and ventured over here!
3962,22 November 2024 at 14:18,"Yes, we are here. We left X. Although we especially miss our dog friends from Twitter we don not miss X.
#ZSHQ"
3963,22 November 2024 at 12:28,Hey guys and gals. I know we are all miserably hurting and we are legit scared. This kind of energy from their side towards us with the constant screaming and yelling is why I left X.  It’s poison. Vicious and spitefull. Can we take a pause for a while and just let their poison out? Then we trounce
3964,22 November 2024 at 13:33,"It's getting hard to continue to defend 
#PrinceHarry
 & 
#MeghanMarkle
. I left X,  but I still see articles so full of blatant LIES.  I'm angry because i see derangers as the MAGA maggots. Incapable of logic or critical thinking. U can't reason with them. They only have HATE. What's wrong with people?"
3965,22 November 2024 at 13:51,"Absolutely, I want them all very far away from me. They’re really revealing how pathetic they are. They’re literally stalking the left. Left X and now they’re coming over here looking for libs to harass. Like give it a break 🤦🏾‍♀️"
3966,22 November 2024 at 11:50,Many of us have left X I was wondering if you still get patients this time of year. Most will be hibernating and any out in the open won’t last long
3967,23 November 2024 at 13:15,Anyone play sims 4?!!! Add me I need my summer friends on this app since I left X 😂
3968,23 November 2024 at 14:00,"I left X to avoid this rage bate. This is essentially just profit from crown holdings not tax payer money. Should it be taxed? Yes. Does he have way to much wealth? Yes. Should Parliament pay for royal events? Lots of business is generated, so maybe? Is it salary from tax income? No."
3969,23 November 2024 at 13:02,"Why is this platform full of hatefilled trolls?

No one wishes to engage with actual knowledge but spew out vile trash 
Glad you trolls left X

This social media is terrible"
3970,23 November 2024 at 10:21,One of the reasons I left X wasn’t just the political stuff but also that it had become more like YouTube than social media. Very little social interaction just lots of content creators doing their thing. Let’s do it differently here
3971,23 November 2024 at 10:23,😭😭😭😭the libs left X and all you have is dumb MAGA to talk too😭😭😭😭boo hoo
3972,23 November 2024 at 10:17,"I left X so I am one of the 20,000…but here we are…carry in please"
3973,23 November 2024 at 15:56,"Ever notice that right-wingers are always mad, even when they win? Their boy won the election. And they mad. All the liberals left X. And they mad. It’s like they know, on at least a subconscious level, they really need us to make their lives bearable.

3975,23 November 2024 at 16:37,"The only people leaving X are ones that are banned, or extremist who were owned in a debate and walked away.
Bluesky is no different in the sense that you will have all types here just like on X, so if you left X because of Elon, congrats, Elon isn't here, for everyone else, this is twitter/X light."
3976,23 November 2024 at 16:42,Wow! I left x to be called stupid because I enjoyed a tv show!
3977,23 November 2024 at 04:30,Hey there Mark! So many of you guys left X that I thought I’d stop by and say hi. I know you can’t see it yet but it’s gonna be a great 4 years! You’ll see😊
3978,23 November 2024 at 04:55,"Holy Shit! You lunatic left libtards are fucking hilarious! You left X because it finally became a sight where everyone could speak, to come here. To make it like Twitter, before Elon. So now you're just yelling bullshit lies back and forth to each other. You people are absolutely fucking pathetic."
3979,23 November 2024 at 03:41,You’re not normal you created this app just to troll people who want to use it and left X. Lmao that’s not normal behavior at all

3982,23 November 2024 at 19:08,Left X (twitter) for bluer skies. Happy to be here!
3983,23 November 2024 at 18:44,"I finally left X as @karbonboy and I starting fresh here with no intent to even attract followers.

What's disappointing is that I can't even post a 59 second video reduced to 720p. So I will link to YouTube for this short test video. www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZauY..."
3984,23 November 2024 at 18:48,"Just seen the light, now left X formerly Twitter for democracy sake"
3985,23 November 2024 at 18:06,"@leonardousa.bsky.social
 we left X because we were arguing with people who could not accept facts."
3986,23 November 2024 at 17:30,I left X forever
3987,23 November 2024 at 19:14,"I left X because people matter more than money. Integrity matters. Caring about others, regardless of their differences, or bank accounts. Hate has no place in my life. 
May the future be brighter than it appears to be. 🙏"
3988,23 November 2024 at 19:31,Hey blue-sky! I left X the day the bird disappeared. It so nice to see familiar faces & news heads on here to share the important we should hear & share! Thank you guys!!!!
3989,23 November 2024 at 18:14,Just report and block. Don't give these losers attention. They are just mad everyone left X and they are lonely.

I am happy to announce I've left X.
I don't regret it for one second."
3991,23 November 2024 at 20:26,Lol...I'm sure if all the toxic liberals left X and came here...it's still the same as the first picture
3992,23 November 2024 at 20:18,I left X a long time ago. So excited about Bluesky and happy to be following you again. I would a follow back
3993,22 November 2024 at 20:34,"@mika-brzezinski.bsky.social
 Welcome here! I understand that you left X like me. And kudos for talking to Trump. The people don‘t understand that that is no „normalizing“. 👍🏼"
3994,22 November 2024 at 21:18,"I left X/Twitter behind, and am ready to move on…"
3995,22 November 2024 at 18:45,"I left X a while back because I simply didn't want to participate in a social media site that was obviously catering toward the whims of racists, antisemites, and anti-democracy activists. I joined Bluesky to connect with fellow academics, not because I needed a ""safe space"" or anything like that."
3996,22 November 2024 at 18:57,"Some of it too is a question of just who is sticking to the old platform. I finally made the move here when a favorite artist and author (non USA) left X (this after I had meant to start 🦋 with my email invite).

I expect that type of influence to quickly pick up energy and weight. 🌊"
3997,22 November 2024 at 19:17,I missed you muchly when you left X..I am glad to be on the Crew resisting BLOTUS.
3998,22 November 2024 at 21:33,I fully left X and deactivated my account.  I stayed for the election.  There is no point to remaining there now.
3999,22 November 2024 at 20:47,I just left X HATE to come over to Blue Sky! Would Love Some Followers!
4000,22 November 2024 at 20:31,"Why am I being bombarded by women wanting sex, i left X because of this!!!"
4001,22 November 2024 at 20:30,"which is why they all left X.
we called out their lies with facts and logic.
just like telling us trump said drink bleach, for years they repeated that lie and refused to ""read"" or watch the truth"
4002,22 November 2024 at 20:36,"I left X, FOR GOOD, deleted my account with Truth Social, like X, allows disrespect and vulgarity.And may support communism and fascism. I can't deal with that. Bluesky and Tribel are the most decent social media platforms I'd seen in a long time!THANKS for letting me take refuge here."
4003,22 November 2024 at 21:53,"Well, my decision has been made. I have left X for good! I’m a simple man who has opinions and loves video games and music. I make videos on YouTube and get this slapped on me by Elon… what a jerky jerkface"
4004,22 November 2024 at 22:12,"For women, and a lot of men too, we left X because of the continuous 💩 and abuse from Elon’s paid trolls & bots. It felt like being in a psychologically abusive relationship!! There was no “seeing 2 sides”, just theirs. It became a hateful 💩hole. They missed the point of why?"
4005,22 November 2024 at 22:19,Excited to see you with the Pacific Symphony in April. Followed you over here when I left X. Will be nice to see you play again. It’s been far too long. Here’s a throwback for ya…
4006,22 November 2024 at 22:23,"Friends and family, as you know, I have left X and joined up here with Bluesky. I have two accounts, one for me personally and one for Justice for Black Farmers. Generally, this page will be personal, family, or anything political. 
@bfarmerjustice.bsky.social
 is specifically justice sorts of things."
4007,18 November 2024 at 23:59,So happy I finally left X and came here!
4008,19 November 2024 at 00:06,People really left X/Twitter just to get in here and complain about X/Twitter.

4013,18 November 2024 at 23:19,it's hilarious that we left x and they followed us bc they stopped getting reactions
4014,18 November 2024 at 23:18,"Hi Ana, I left X a long time ago when  Musk bought  it. I used to follow you there.  Now I am thrilled to follow here.  I respect you Lady to no end!!"

4016,19 November 2024 at 00:34,"Yes, I left 
#X
 because it was far too RIGHT, and 
#BlueSky
 is far too LEFT. I'm starting to think they are the cause of all the hate I get for being in the middle!"
4017,19 November 2024 at 02:00,"I haven’t left X, but I’ve stopped posting there.  Saving my musings for here."
4018,22 November 2024 at 16:48,"I left X because after Trump's win X became infested with MAGA supporters. It doesn't help that the owner of X Elon Musk, is a close Trump ally as well. Got tired of the false negative narrative about the Trans community on X."
4019,19 November 2024 at 20:20,I’ve largely left X. I still have an account because I need my train delay updates.  That’s all.
4020,22 November 2024 at 17:26,They don't address the reason many women left ...I left X because I was getting threats of violence whenever I liked a liberal tweet.  Also when reporting the threats of SA I'd get messages back saying they found nothing wrong with the offending tweet.  Elon Must is a Misogynist.
4021,22 November 2024 at 15:31,"Okay, This kind of generalized name-calling and inflammatory rhetoric is precisely why people have left X. I'm reporting you, and I'm putting you on my moderation list."
4022,22 November 2024 at 16:23,So glad you’re here I enjoy your work.  Left x for good this week. I already had that account blocked.  🍻
4023,22 November 2024 at 15:35,Who cares? It's not a serious thing to begin with and Elon doesn't own it.  I left X cuz I can't stand Elon and try not to support him... He needs a L
4024,22 November 2024 at 16:12,"People are going to act like folks left X because their feelings were hurt after the election when Elon was truly plastering Tr*mp everywhere, & the discovery feed having more and more trickles of -phobes, and -ists that seemed oddly specific for a site with so much data about their users…"
4025,22 November 2024 at 16:20,The question then is who moderates the moderators. In this case it feels like the users themselves have left X for a platform whose moderation is more aligned to what they want.
4026,23 November 2024 at 01:16,This is spot on. I left X specifically because there were just more and more Nazis and bigots or more weirdly accounts suggesting mushrooms as treatment if I typed autism (happened a lot). I expected some of that on social media but when your timeline is 90% of that nonsense it is time to go.
4027,23 November 2024 at 02:59,This sucks. I came to Bluesky because so many fiction magazines left X. I write fiction (without ai) and do photography and lately gen ai art. But all the literary magazines have strict no ai policies for text/images. If I start posting my ai images here will they all block me? I think they might.
4028,22 November 2024 at 17:34,"WE DONT WANT THE CHAOS, ANGER, DIVISION, HARASSMENT, THE MISINFORMATION. THAT'S WHY WE LEFT X, INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK. WE ARE SICK OF THAT SHIT!"
4029,29 November 2024 at 14:07,You and Jojo left x hahahahaha who wins
4030,2 December 2024 at 14:19,So as I left X are they having a meltdown over there?
4031,2 December 2024 at 13:49,I left X about 6 months ago when I noticed trump propaganda started to show up on my feed and even though I blocked some of the content more content was popping up. That was a clear indication of the platform soliciting this type of propaganda.
4032,2 December 2024 at 14:37,"Is this left leaning?? I left X because I never saw what I wanted to see and just way too much advertising & promoted posts.
Think seeing different opinions is valuable - if it stays respectful."
4033,3 December 2024 at 03:29,"Listen to this guy he left X, and Truth social because those fascist tried to shut him up."
4034,3 December 2024 at 03:49,"What I’ve noticed about democrats is, they want to hurt and hit but they don’t want to face any consequence, that’s why you left x, you want to dropped your insults and controversial opinion without receiving anysort of backlash, if y’all had the power you would take away right to opinion"
4035,3 December 2024 at 01:13,It is similar to X! Many people left X because of Elon Musk! Bluesky is more like the old Twitter before Musk bought it! X became a cesspool of trolls and bots!
4036,3 December 2024 at 01:09,"now that many have left x, quite a few trouble
makers are here.
being kind is better!"
4037,3 December 2024 at 00:43,I'm not sure how I feel about Blue Sky. I left X several years ago for a variety of reasons. Social media is great place to make connections with people around the world. It is also a haven for misinformation & a digital landfill of non-sense. Not sure how long I will be here. Just one day at a time
4038,3 December 2024 at 02:22,Appreciate that you mention it.  I won't go to the article and let them benefit from getting more traffic. But I also left X after getting likes from fake Elon accounts.
4039,28 November 2024 at 23:29,We left X and now we’re here.
4040,29 November 2024 at 17:37,You are telling the Truth Millions have left x
4041,3 December 2024 at 16:23,"I do not watch the news. I do so for my mental health. Same reason why I left X. 
Not trustworthy, biased and full of fear mongering. 
Stress inducing"
4042,3 December 2024 at 16:48,"I’m not suggesting BlueSky is more than it is. But you’re treating X as more than IT is. Email? As if it’s the universal utility? I left X when it was first bought/not recently, so I’m not devoted to it. But X isn’t all that. It’s the FB of community chats, once dominant, inevitably fading."
4043,4 December 2024 at 10:25,"421 million active users every month, and you really believe that a few people from Germany are no longer trying to plunge the platform into irrelevance. Cute ;)

Btw. Blocking your profile does not mean that you have left 
#X

Go on, accept this final consequence!"
4044,3 December 2024 at 19:41,"Oh, and I'm blocking the MAGA fuckwits that approach me on here. I left X for a reason. Go there, where the cult members agree with you."
4045,4 December 2024 at 11:28,Mondo! I have missed you since I left X
4046,4 December 2024 at 11:18,"Arseholes and mansplainers have arrived…..immediate block, can’t be on with that shit anymore, I left X for a reason."

4050,4 December 2024 at 15:08,Chuckling. I left X to get away from them !
4051,4 December 2024 at 17:44,"When rats abandon a sinking ship, they invade the closest dry spot to land. I guess it is inevitable they left X and looked for where the food is… and BlueSky has been getting a lot of attention"

4053,4 December 2024 at 18:12,Left X (formally known as Twitter) a few months ago. I’m hoping this app is better ❤️
4054,3 December 2024 at 19:10,"As long as you left X/Twitter, that's all that matters. It's only garbage & trash made of garbage & trash. Propaganda is cancer, and on X it's Stage 4 and terminal.

Doing things while having real conversations about problems and their solutions is what matters going forward."
4055,3 December 2024 at 19:08,"Hi, I just came over from Threads- left X when Musk bought it.. never looked back."
4056,3 December 2024 at 19:20,"So so,
Left x after
The election. Bracing myself for the next four years"
4057,3 December 2024 at 17:44,We also left X to the far-right which may provide to be a negative thing given that they will likely have less oversight
4058,3 December 2024 at 23:01,"Elonia doesn’t care that we left X.   He doesn’t care that it’s lost 80% of its value.  He bought it to silence the left, give a megaphone to the right, and win an election for the 🍊💩.  He succeeded and since the election his net worth has risen $70,000,000,000."
4059,3 December 2024 at 18:32,I left X/Twitter because Muck so strangled the reach of all progressive/liberal/Democrat accounts as to make tweeting a hopeless ineffective endeavor! Not because I don’t like him! Which I don’t! I despise him and those like him!
4060,4 December 2024 at 20:10,I left X and missed you.  Just joined BlueSky and SO glad to find YOU here!
4061,4 December 2024 at 21:48,How many of us here left X? 🙋‍♀️
4062,4 December 2024 at 21:44,I’ve missed your posts since I left X…glad to see you again here!
4063,4 December 2024 at 18:15,"I left X in hopes of finding some great friends on this site. My music, from the new album, is on many worldwide music streaming platforms. Take a listen and let me know what you think. Peace be with all of you and remember to ""Love One Another""."
4064,4 December 2024 at 21:39,"Pretty new to Bluesky and left X but did not use much. 

Looking at a post I did not create, I was trying to look at comments, is this not available??"

4067,4 December 2024 at 05:07,"Insofar as the common ground of Bluesky is ""was on Twitter, was on X, left X"", then I will never share that common ground. As years pass, there will be more and more young adults who were never on X, let alone on Twitter."

Respectfully, I left X to find peace of thought & discourse. 

You are barking up the wrong tree on my thread here; it is not my responsibility to educate you.

Do your own research & support your own conclusions."

 you are the kind of shit bot profiles we left X to avoid. pls go away."
4072,2 December 2024 at 07:32,"Nope. 

You can’t defend your position when an opposing viewpoint smacks you in your face. Thats why you left X."
4073,2 December 2024 at 12:28,"Bythis logic, those leaving an abusive spouse are pursuing purity politics? Sorry, I left X because it was a cesspool of hate."

4076,2 December 2024 at 23:34,Yesterday was the last of it. I'm sad about it. ☹️😋🤭 p.s. I'm glad I found you on Bluesky! (I left x/twitter/bird)
4077,2 December 2024 at 23:37,I left X a long time ago. I came here because my goal is to reach Democrats about how off the rails their party is. Why they are not connecting with enough people across the country.
4078,3 December 2024 at 03:35,"This is because we all left X, in mass. And I hope every news site follows…except Fox News, Newsmax and Epoch times…they can stay on X where they are loved and seen as true journalists and news sources. Here…not so much."

4084,3 December 2024 at 12:37,We are following your good information already left x searching for the tweet places to meet - gone are the old ways -gone are the newspapers except for Christian Science monitor
4085,3 December 2024 at 12:21,You left X because your left thoughts started being checked with fact and common sense. You couldn’t spew untruths for the world anymore. Nobody who has facts has left X. Just people with emotion.
4086,3 December 2024 at 05:16,"You speak of our constitution, yet, obviously have zero knowledge of it.
That's why you left X, remember?
Free speech is free speech, regardless.
That's our constitution, dumdum.
What would a reTARD know of fascism?"
4087,3 December 2024 at 11:46,"At first, I avoided him but later I countered his disinformation and that was when he severely limited by reach on x. My followers thought I had left x. My tweets disappeared and my data numbers were in single digits. My followers were not even getting any tweets from me."
4088,2 December 2024 at 14:13,Oh. I guess I should say why I left X. Formerly Twitter. Cause Elon Musk bought it and the algo wasn’t pushing my stuff. But honestly I rarely used it after he bought it. He made it gross. Also the algo sucked!!! Like really bad. Glad people finally got the hint.
4089,2 December 2024 at 13:29,Welcome to Bluesky!  Glad you left X.   Elon is a disinformation machine.
4090,2 December 2024 at 15:47,"I'm a sick person? Are you ok? I left X to get away from name-calling. Theft is an issue for big & small biz. U don't own a small retail biz? CVS' response was over the top. Close the damn place if loss is that bad. But when you give ""dignity""to theft, you will pay a higher price at the register."
4091,2 December 2024 at 10:33,I left X soon after Elon purchased it.
4092,2 December 2024 at 13:59,I left X the day Leon took control. The writing in the wall was so large it could be seen from space.
4093,2 December 2024 at 13:11,"I'm OK with it because I clearly know better than you. Now go back to X where you belong. We don't want toxic liars here. That's why we left X.

4101,17 November 2024 at 22:45,if you left X for Bluesky simply because that “other site” is owned by a Trump supporter and are in here preaching tolerance YOU are the hypocrite. Practice what you preach…even to those you consider your “enemy”.

4104,2 December 2024 at 19:56,1. Left X because it was SO negative and toxic and the community on here is 10/10

4107,5 December 2024 at 23:58,"Twitter have been a great place for many years and I actually think that BlueSky is much alike. Twitter had many great things to offer and no reason to get angry about anything. 
Angry is why we left X, Bluesky is different, still changing."

4109,6 December 2024 at 13:17,"I don’t think the lack of porn star presence here has much connection to political ideology. There are a lot more adult performers who are on the left than the three you named.

4113,6 December 2024 at 01:25,Here you are. I thought you were leaving the country when Donald J Trump won the election ? You didn’t leave the country you just left X. You can run but you can’t hide from your loony left liberal idiotic comments. This country needs a serious reset. You comments are irrelevant. Sanity is back.

4163,30 November 2024 at 15:43,I know a lot of upset liberals left X and felt they didn't get a fair shake. Wanted you to know that there's people out there that appreciate your efforts and would like to present to you a participation ribbon for the election. You tried.

4166,30 November 2024 at 16:39,Yes.  I left X because of this and how toxic it had become.  I could not get rid of all the video game ads that kept coming back.
4167,30 November 2024 at 14:24,"I was surprised bc I had several MAGA ppl responding to my posts

I’m very critical of our SCOTUS & say so

I commented on Leon (Musk) & that brought out the hate, usual stupid uneducated remarks

4171,1 December 2024 at 18:30,"Nothing to do with Musk, I've got no opinion about him, I left X because it was full of people who sounded like a bunch of elderly drunks up for a scrap. And it was repetitive. The same comments, same insults, same nonsense from the same AI sources. Stopped enjoying it so no point."
4172,1 December 2024 at 12:43,You left x?
4173,1 December 2024 at 17:48,I left X for the same reason I don’t frequent bars where the band plays behind chicken coop wire.

4175,1 December 2024 at 20:14,"Agree. X offers a terrible customer experience by refusing to moderate content & behaviour and removing functions that keep people safe. The fact that Trump followers enjoy that is about them, not about the many decent people who left X. It’s not just Dems it’s people all over the world."
4176,1 December 2024 at 17:45,"We left X because it's an unmoderated, feunmotivated, full of Nazis, cryptobros, christofascists, and incels.

I don't hang out with these people in real life, and I sure as hell am not going to hang out with them on social media.

What an absolut horseshit take."

4178,1 December 2024 at 17:38,I left X because the level of hate is not what I choose to surround myself with. The only hope for Democrats going forward is to form our own underground information system ie newspaper. MSM is part of the propaganda machine Save yours for X.
4179,1 December 2024 at 18:10,I left X because they permanently banned me and I never knew why. Decided today to join and hope that this site is more enjoyable and hoping for followers to have conversations and laughs with💖💙
4180,1 December 2024 at 19:57,"I left X because of the  brutality, the misogyny, the racism, the horrific name calling, the foreign bots. As if that’s not enough reason, the severe lack of language skills, humanity or humour made it fkn unbearable."
4181,1 December 2024 at 19:36,Lolol that’s why I left X. He made the app a heap of hot trash covered in shit and it should die a slow death until forgotten for eternity.

You lost it all.  Therefore, we get to make the policies & rules. You get to grieve."
4192,1 December 2024 at 22:27,I left X because I didn’t like it there anymore.  It really is that simple.
4193,2 December 2024 at 00:04,"I'm not alone. The reason why most left leaning people left x is because maga have been intolerable for 9 yrs, you can post so much facts and they won't research themselves.

4200,1 December 2024 at 15:47,"I left X because it no longer serves me. The blue check spammers at the top of comments block any interesting discussion. The hate bombing and disgusting bigotry are intolerable. It’s not about “purity,” it’s about basic decency."
4201,1 December 2024 at 13:31,Left X for Bluesky when I realized I didn’t sign up for a course on ‘How to Have the Correct Opinions'.
4202,1 December 2024 at 14:06,I left x weeks ago. so many journalists say they left but still post there. I guess they just can't give up the followers and likes on x. do they get paid or something? there is no amount of coin could get me to stay. I'm not enabling that crap.
4203,1 December 2024 at 14:20,If you left X cos of Elon Moscow you should follow me and I'll follow you back! No questions asked

4217,29 November 2024 at 13:08,I have officially left X. What a relief
4218,29 November 2024 at 11:43,"I find it depressing that the people I followed over here from x, after they claimed to have left x, then find out they are still sneaking back to x to post over there too."
4219,29 November 2024 at 06:26,"Listen, I left X because of a disgusting picture of Harris bowing before Trump that Barron posted there. It was too much even for Musk who deleted it. That kid is not embarrassed. He is just as bad as his father."

4222,29 November 2024 at 04:27,Vice President Musk is the reason that  I left X . As more continue to leave X his tone will certainly change. I am new here and appreciate followers.

4233,29 November 2024 at 18:47,Not giving MAGA any more oxygen. Why I left X the black cesspool of Evil doers. No longer want to suck in that negative energy. I just hope Bluesky will not over look the MAGA propaganda spreaders and harassers. I am on here looking for my tribe of Truth seekers and Truth speakers
4234,29 November 2024 at 19:01,"That is fine. Wish you led with this. It is concerning.

I left X to avoid disinformation. I’m just pointing out the article you cited has NOTHING to do with what you said. It is about the price of heating fuel vs electricity. 

You literally live in LA, what is your annual heating fuel cost?"
4235,29 November 2024 at 16:10,"ahh, my mistake, I thought we were having a discussion about realistic strategy adjustment for future success. Didn't recognize the cues earlier that you were looking for a chorus of accepting your vibes as fact.

4242,8 December 2024 at 14:22,"Someone did something REALLY messed up to me during a low point of my life, when I needed support most.

4243,8 December 2024 at 18:08,"Pleased to follow you here, but also still on X. Sad that so many have left X. It means the echo chambers just get more of an echo. I also worry as how long Blue-sky will remain troll free."

Welcome to Bluesky.
Now maybe find a new vet. 😊"
4245,8 December 2024 at 19:50,Negative. You bluecry people need a bit of push back. All you do over here if parrot lies and bs. That's why yall left X. Couldn't handle people telling you were wrong
4246,8 December 2024 at 21:19,"I've left X, but my financial support level hasn't changed.  I'm seeing more new people asking for support on this platform than on X.  So that is good.  Will just take time for everyone to get adjusted to the new surroundings."

Everyone has left X
And while I’m glad Bluesky exists, I don’t feel like I’ve found my groove/community here

The platform is still quite young and developing. I left X with 25k followers simply because of its growing links with extreme right-wingers."
4422,12 September 2024 at 12:50,"I'd say that Brazil is breathing life into a world which doesn't need X. Like millions, I left X after it began to feel like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Hearing that much of Brazil was moving onto Bluesky brought me along too. It is a viable infant with great possibilities for the future."
4423,17 September 2024 at 19:30,"Thanks for the invite. Glad you finally left X after I did..lol  Congrats,  we're both x""s now. Lmfao 😆 🤣 😂"
4424,22 September 2024 at 17:11,I found you on Blue sky. I left X over a year ago as the asshole to normal people ratio was getting too high for me. I'm still on FB but more for social groups.
4425,22 September 2024 at 19:25,"I think the reason some have reacted with such hostility to the article is that it suggests they ran away from free debate to champagne liberal coziness. 

Thing is, some left X not because it was toxic or a haven for Nazis, though that would be enough, but because staying funds Musk."
4426,23 September 2024 at 16:20,"It's so annoying!
I literally left X because of the bot spam and now it's appearing here too. I hope the bsky devs will be able to handle it a bit better than Musky Wusky does."
4427,22 September 2024 at 19:52,Never been to a Stoke Newington drinks party so that comparison is lost on me but I left X because the people whose varied views I found interesting (tho not necessarily agreeing w) were drowned out by views I found unenlightened AND disagreed with. Happy to see the feel of old Twitter grow here!😎
4428,22 September 2024 at 21:12,Fostering any sort of intellectual conversation that many of us seek. That’s why we left X. There was no way to have a civil debate because of Nazis coming in and calling you slurs or threatening to dox you over a very reasonable view/opinion. At least here people generally respect each other. (2/2)
4429,23 September 2024 at 09:47,What comforts me (I left X this morning) is that the Right always eats itself.
4430,21 September 2024 at 17:52,I hope now that those who left X because they were shut out  have experienced life on competing social platforms will decide to remain outside of Elon's space
4431,24 September 2024 at 07:13,"No offense to the influx of noobs, but if I can post my own media, so can you. And if your “content” is just reskeets of people that I already follow, why’d you even bother to come to this community when you left X? Get onboard or get off.

This has been my TED Talk."
4432,23 September 2024 at 21:12,"The sheer amount of transphobia and other bigotry bs in there was WAAAAY too much for me to handle

Sincerely, my stress/anxiety levels dropped ever since i left X/Twitter... all my comm clients were already in contact with me elsewhere sooo..."
4433,27 September 2024 at 09:20,"I left 'X' two months ago. I'd love to say it's been freeing and joyful, but tbh it's been pretty miserable. And I'm considering going back. I know I am grieving, though, for something that no longer exists."
4434,18 September 2024 at 22:09,"I think heat of the moment stuff in a match, especially one like that, is to be expected and I don't mind it too much. If it's pre-meditated or following an agenda, or is overly personal or abusive, that's when it crosses a line for me. I've not long left X though so my tolerance is high 😂"
4435,7 October 2024 at 11:20,I left X-crement as soon as the psychopath took over. I am the happier for it. Good for you for ditching that toxic platform. I wish more would do the same!
4436,7 October 2024 at 09:23,"I finally left X. I hate to use that name. But Twitter died a long time ago. I just couldn't accept it.

This is scary for me. Twitter gave me so much. Visibility & community when I've been locally isolated and ignored.

But Twitter is gone. And X is poison. I can't be part of that anymore."
4437,17 October 2024 at 17:00,I dont mind calling it x because it is a very different site now. I joined Twitter. I left x.

4446,9 October 2024 at 20:02,"I left X to try and avoid politics. I don’t care who you vote for, but I don’t wanna see this. Why is it that people got so toxic about politics? We all just want a better America. 😰I miss the days when candidates wrote catchy songs instead of constant bashing. You can’t tell who’s being truthful."
4447,9 October 2024 at 16:29,"👍 I left X for a reason, don’t need to be seeing all that nonsense over here."
4448,19 October 2024 at 09:48,"I can see why (per the FT) the Stoke Newington chatterati like BlueSky, but most normies left X for Threads, and most business folk retreated to LinkedIn…
My cross-posting does wild numbers on Threads - 6-7k impressions, 100s likes/comments. Should I bother to keep talking to the wall on BlueSky?!"
4449,19 October 2024 at 00:46,I’m already glad I left X
4450,19 October 2024 at 02:49,Elon should have changed the block feature sooner. That way ppl would have left X sooner instead of giving him money for the stupid check mark.

4561,14 November 2024 at 15:19,I sort of feel like an outsider because I left X when Musk took over and only returned for a couple of months (with a new account) before the election and left again. So I’m not really a refugee.

4570,14 November 2024 at 16:07,"That’s why I left X right on the day of the election because I wasn’t gonna stay on a platform that promoted Trump that had Elon Musk pay people to vote and no consequences for the illegal act. You may as well call X truth, social ultimate."

The ones left on X who don’t care about the new TOS and those who don’t “see” the misinformation/propaganda as what it is… those people are not invested in politics but they still vote

X is nothing anymore. It’s Elon forcing garbage on people. If you can’t curate your feed, there’s something wrong with the platform. If engagement Is much higher here (which it is) then who cares?"
4597,10 November 2024 at 02:54,"Had my day ruined today by some unsavoury sorts feeling low today, I didn't need to see it yet there it was.i don't take negative stuff well hence why I left X it's what I like about this place haven't seen it anywhere a place i actually feel welcome.

4603,11 November 2024 at 02:25,I left X when they stopped you being able to block people and that's why I like Bluesky. It has more options to moderate bad behaviour and there's no algorythym promoting hate and anger. I'd consider supporting it through a small subscription if it continues providing value to me.
4604,11 November 2024 at 01:02,funny how I haven't missed her at all since I left X

4608,11 November 2024 at 08:10,Just deactivated my X account. Have you left X too?
4609,11 November 2024 at 09:53,"The vanity and ego is funny, especially from a group that likes to think of itself as open to new ideas. And for clarity, not arguing that they should have left x, but at least have established a toehold here, even if it meant posting into the void in the early days"

4617,10 November 2024 at 16:57,I left X for good. Still in shock over Nov5. It’s time to get back up & get started on surviving the next 4 years. Also time to get started on working towards something better.

4625,11 November 2024 at 23:02,I joined this past Saturday. My anxiety level had gone down several notches since I left X. The toxicity over there is not good for my wellbeing. Even the name Bluesky makes me feel more peaceful.
4626,11 November 2024 at 23:06,"OK, Ron. I’m not being a prude but the reason I left X was because it just got ugly. So you post a pic of the “finger”…"

4752,21 November 2024 at 07:53,That is a powerful statement and laying down a marker for sure.  Would love to see more institutions show this type of leadership.    I've left X a couple of weeks ago - it shouldn't be acceptable or 'okay' for a platform like that to exist with such minimal regulation.
4753,21 November 2024 at 04:17,"If you had read the replies, you'd see that the posts I'm talking about aren't ""healthy debate."" They're mean, name calling, trollish responses to nice people.

4840,20 November 2024 at 19:50,Here's another reason that I left X. Nuclear energy stans. You cannot argue with these people despite incident after incident proving that it's unsafe. This site is nearly the same age as the Chernobyl plant. beyondnuclearinternational.org/2024/11/17/l...
4841,20 November 2024 at 20:03,I left X months ago and I missed seeing the people I used to follow. So I’m happy I found this place where I can follow a lot of the people again. Hopefully the rest will come over here too.

4843,20 November 2024 at 23:23,I could have sworn i had come on here when it first launched... but honestly don't recall. Left X a year ago. I missed Twitter's format but hated how nasty the place had gotten. Kinda dig this place and how the first 20 responses aren't trolls. I don't even get 20 responses. I'm OK with that. :)
4844,21 November 2024 at 00:57,Left X because it became a waste of time - low information compared to high volume of garbage ads/garbage posts. LinkedIn and YouTube were my alternatives. Eventually came to Bluesky because of the burgeoning interest

4851,20 November 2024 at 03:57,I left X after 3 different month long hiatus. Each time i told myself I'd not interact with vile things and every time the algorithm just threw me more hatred because it's what I interacted with. Finally i just uninstalled it. I only learned about BlueSky through TikTok and hopped on last week

4993,17 November 2024 at 16:19,"Glad I left x, it was getting toxic"
4994,17 November 2024 at 16:24,"Rightwingnuts on X are laughing at people who have left to come to Bluesky. I haven't left X yet, but I won't miss seeing scumbag Elon's posts if I do. Or the rightwingnuts."
4995,17 November 2024 at 18:44,Just left X to join Bluesky. Hello all you lovely Blueskyers.
4996,17 November 2024 at 18:44,Left x for good for real irreversible
4997,16 November 2024 at 21:45,"Britain First have come over here too. Instant block.

Don't they realise people left X because of them?"
4998,16 November 2024 at 21:45,"I always wonder what kind of parents these grown people who use that word, had.  They were probably just as ignorant.  I have also seen an uptick of use of that word on sm lately, and especially before I left x.  Why do we have to share a country with such crass, classless,ignorant, people?"
4999,16 November 2024 at 21:45,"I left X a long time ago when it was Twitter. Right before Musk took control. I joined Tribal, and am also happy to be a part of the Blue family."
5000,16 November 2024 at 22:33,Thank you so much!!! I’m starting from scratch since I left  X Recently
5001,16 November 2024 at 22:16,So I wonder just how many people have left X.
5002,16 November 2024 at 22:34,It's a keeper. One of the good things I packed in my suitcase when I left X.
5003,16 November 2024 at 21:34,"So, after several months of inactivity, I now left X permanently. It’s enough. 

The huge influx here is very nice to see. Flashbacks to 2010-2015 when Twitter went really off."
5004,16 November 2024 at 22:53,Just left X. Not look back.
5005,16 November 2024 at 22:48,"I just enjoy scrolling and not seeing videos of people being ""deleted"". Bluesky is so much tamer and I love only seeing animals and nerdy stuff when I scroll. That's why I left X and why I never used X after making my account."
5006,18 November 2024 at 10:23,I’m so glad you came to Bluesky. I left X way back n recently left Threads . Glad you’re here
5007,18 November 2024 at 08:16,"Hey, great to see you here 💙 I heard Maga is coming here too..🤷‍♀️ they need their daily dose of rage tweeting now that a lot of us have left X 🤔"
5008,18 November 2024 at 11:18,"Raising your voice against Genocide is not “hate speech”. This is a perfect microcosm of how zionism/ antisemitism operates, they colonize you, they attack you and when you raise you voice or respond they're the victims!

Oh, and I left X to get away from the likes of you but you followed me here."
5009,18 November 2024 at 11:18,"I finally left X.  That platform belongs to the MAGA movement, the neo-nazi groups, and for Elon to spread misinformation."
5010,18 November 2024 at 07:19,"Jon, you need to have the conversation here, we left X for a reason."
5011,18 November 2024 at 07:54,"Lmao! Exactly! Cause you people are weak! You all left X cause you can’t have a tolerant conversation with your opposition! You need to be in an eco chamber, a bubble for your weak mindset so you have only people who think like yo do!"
5012,18 November 2024 at 07:39,Please say what you think. Just do it without threatening to rape or kill people. No one left x to escape healthy discord or debate.
5013,18 November 2024 at 07:05,Left X 2 months ago. No regrets.
5014,18 November 2024 at 12:15,"Twitter went . . . THAT ONE 👉 💙🦋

And left X behind.

The End.

5017,18 November 2024 at 11:56,"It's great to be back on bluesky, and to have left X a second time, this time forever!"
5018,18 November 2024 at 12:03,I left X (or maybe it was Twitter at the time) because I didn't want to enrich Musk. It wasn't about trolls or algorithms. It was an easy decision.
5019,18 November 2024 at 06:25,"I stopped watching the news a few weeks before the election and left x about the same time because I needed the mental pause.  Catching clips of the media grappling with what they enabled by being complicit for ratings, tickles me somewhere deep inside my brain."
5020,18 November 2024 at 12:46,"So I joined Blue Sky just to see how long it takes for the liberals fucks who left X to destroy this place. Less than 24 hours after joining I already see it happening with POSTS BEING DELETED, PEOPLE BITCHING ABOUT POSTS and more!

Welcome to hell motherfuckers!"
5021,18 November 2024 at 11:29,Left X when it became X. 👍
5022,18 November 2024 at 15:44,Well left X. I'm tired of blocking people like Traitor Greene and them still showing up on my feed. That and all the BS. I'm already tired of Trump administration and he hasn't even been sworn in again yet. Worrying about the next 4 years and beyond
5023,18 November 2024 at 15:45,"Hello, to my friends, old and new on bsky!! I left X because the owner is becoming more unstable and dangerous by the day. I will still check in with my friends who chose to stay and fight the good fight but will avoid the toxicity of replies and comments."
5024,18 November 2024 at 15:49,"Left X now I’m here!
Bye-Bye ELONia"
5025,18 November 2024 at 13:01,I left X when Musk bought it.  Didn't think I'd be back on a social media platform ever again. So happy to be on Bluesky!
5026,18 November 2024 at 14:43,Hi Luis! I left X a while back but thought I would come here now - will see what happens…
5027,18 November 2024 at 14:54,"I left ""X"" because Elon was stalking me. 

I got my alert that I had a new follower. I looked, it was Elon. I blocked him.

Next thing I knew, there was another alert...and he was following me AGAIN.

1/2"
5028,18 November 2024 at 15:02,Hope we can see more postings over here to keep up. I don't have Telegram and left X a year ago.
5029,18 November 2024 at 15:24,"I've only been here two days, but I already really like it here.👍
I left X because 
@barbrastreisand.bsky.social
 also moved.🥰
I've been looking into your profile on X sometimes.😃
I'm very happy that we found each other here.😄"
5030,18 November 2024 at 15:53,I'm happy that MSN is acknowledging the exodus happening from X to Bluesky (I left X last week). Some of the commenters are really annoyed that Bluesky even exists...haha. There really are some hateful and envious people out there. Makes me glad to be a democrat.
5031,18 November 2024 at 14:26,If I don’t know you plz don’t come in my DMs tryna sell me SHIT!! That’s why I left X bc it was too many ppl beggin for money 🙄
5032,18 November 2024 at 14:34,"Lmao, a meme account blocked me due to this post. He ""left X to get away from people like me"" i.e. posting about politics

So you went to...blueksy?"
5033,18 November 2024 at 13:15,"Is there any way to embed a BlueSky post? I used to occasionally embed a tweet on Twitter right into my blog so that it would show as posted. Having left X, can I do that on BlueSky? Can't find the command if so."
5034,18 November 2024 at 18:02,I left X as soon as it became X so I have no idea how many people stayed.  Some think they can change minds so they stay.
5035,18 November 2024 at 18:47,"Good evening all!
Can I thank all the people who followed me so far. I am so gladI have left X.
It took me a while but after the result of the US elections I felt about as sick as when the Brexit results were announced!"
5036,18 November 2024 at 18:58,I left X the day following the election. I joined bluesky today. I can't tell you how happy I am to find you here!

5038,18 November 2024 at 20:22,I miss him since he left X and was rather hoping to find him here.
5039,18 November 2024 at 05:48,Can we please leave the political bickering out of this new platform I mean that's why a lot of us left X. Post like this are just going to be divisive.
5040,18 November 2024 at 05:33,"I left X, it’s a toxic fascist propaganda machine. This platform feels kinder, safer and more humane."
5041,18 November 2024 at 05:21,Left X and 3500 resisters. Just found Blue Sky. So happy to see you here!
5042,18 November 2024 at 03:34,"In hindsight,  we should have all left x the minute musk took over and not added fuel to their dumpster fire."
5043,18 November 2024 at 03:39,I missed you since I left x a year ago!
5044,18 November 2024 at 03:36,I left X the day after the election with nearly 5K followers. Would love to regain some followers and meet new like-minded Bluesky converts! Long live freedom of speech!
5045,15 November 2024 at 13:23,He follows no one and his first post is in some weird font. Left X to get away from that.
5046,15 November 2024 at 12:32,Just a discussion point. Supporting Elon Musk overrides that decision? I’m just curious as that is why most have left X.
5047,15 November 2024 at 13:43,"I have left X and feel a lot happier already.

How long before the far right loons turn on each other 🤣"
5048,15 November 2024 at 10:58,"As I left X for the second time, I hereby pledge not to got back to it until Musk maintains the ownership of that social network. Fed up with the machine/human trash it upholds."

5053,15 November 2024 at 19:05,Meta's been doing this for a while. Having left X I'm more worried about Facebook.
5054,15 November 2024 at 19:14,Left x and brought my talents to blue sky.
5055,15 November 2024 at 17:56,BLUESKY - How many people have now left X and joined Bluesky. Not that Musk cares since he ran it into the ground once he took over
5056,15 November 2024 at 17:56,"PLEASE don't ""serve us posts you think we like"". That's NOT what we like. That's the reason we left X. 

Just let the feed flow like traffic in Central Park. We'll find the accounts we like BY OURSELVES, THANKS."

5060,15 November 2024 at 19:25,"Hi everyone! I'm new here and excited to connect with all of you. I recently left X and am eager to find new friends and share ideas. If you’re interested, please drop a follow, and I’ll be sure to follow back! I'm passionate about the resistance against Trump and his agenda."
5061,18 November 2024 at 21:18,"So the trolls are up & running 
Pissed off we have left X & it’s BS to move here where the serenity is back from the good old twitter days

Rather funny really
Did space baby really think we’d stay there?
Not the sharpest"
5062,18 November 2024 at 17:44,I left X as soon as Musk took over. It needs to crash and burn
5063,18 November 2024 at 17:04,SO great to see your happy post. I left X and am glad to find you here.
5064,18 November 2024 at 16:45,I left x to get rid of this nationalist shite.

Anyone there be trashing Elon Musk? 👀"

5071,19 November 2024 at 15:11,So glad you’re here. Was hoping to see you! I left X and the crazy.
5072,19 November 2024 at 13:40,"Have completely changed news sources on TV. BBC, Reuters, with a little PBS News Hour. Left X, weaning myself off Facebook, and Threads."
5073,19 November 2024 at 14:49,"I left X a couple of months ago, I didn’t know about this app until a few days ago, then I was excited to find everyone over here. 🥹🥰"
5074,19 November 2024 at 05:02,"I left X, but before I did, I told Elon to Live, Laugh, Toaster Bath.

5077,19 November 2024 at 01:15,"Yasss!! Congratulations to all that have left X. It's nothing but a massive fascist cess pool of propaganda that delivers ""mass psychosis"" to its followers. The air is much cleaner up here in the BlueSky. Check out my new political satire creation called 
##Satan'sHelper's
 inside MAGA's-GOP morality"
5078,19 November 2024 at 01:24,"My politics have changed dramatically since my 20s, largely because social media exposed me to different points of view. I didn't leave X out of fear of different points of view; I left X because it's full of people with the exact same point of view as every old white person I grew up with."
5079,19 November 2024 at 01:24,"Yes, we can kick some of them out of the House and Senate in the mid-terms. With enough of a flip, we might impeach Trump again and remove him from office.

5097,19 November 2024 at 20:03,I agree & also all the never-Trumpers left “X” like cockroaches. So the quality of the posts on BlueSky is lame as well. They ruin everything
5098,19 November 2024 at 20:19,And leave a platform full of those kind of people. So glad I left X behind.
5099,21 November 2024 at 02:41,"Left X
somewhere along the way, the vibe shifted from a thrilling starry sky to a chaotic black hole of doomscrolling and hot takes.

Joining BlueSky, where the air feels lighter, the skies brighter, and the conversations more… sane."
5100,21 November 2024 at 02:13,Nah you good totally understand and yeah absolutely he is dw he won’t be getting any more attention and not sure why either probably because everyone he used argue with left x.

5102,21 November 2024 at 01:49,I find it funny that the right wingers are angry that perfect competition is actually working because we all left X when a better product entered the market.
5103,21 November 2024 at 02:54,"This. 
I left X when it was still Twitter, have violently banged my head on many a wall, lurked around threads for a while and I'm within days of deleting it because this is what I've been missing. 💙Bluesky"
5104,20 November 2024 at 20:08,Wondering why there is so much hateful comments on the platform. I thought we left the hate at X. Seems like everyone who left X brought their anger and hate along with them. Let it go!

5108,21 November 2024 at 11:35,"We're glad to have you here. Truly. This can be a better place if we keep our eyes on the ball.
Because the ass-hats are coming & here. Not enough for them to taint Twitter. They chase.
But if you left X for something better what if we collectively.. leave the USA for something better?
Cause we can."
5109,21 November 2024 at 12:04,"I'm so tired of the hate, that's why I left X. But there is so much hate here. What happened to loving one another?"
5110,21 November 2024 at 14:33,Red Wave- I left X because of all the name calling.  Hope you have a better experience here and open to hear opposing opinions.  And receptive to facts.
5111,21 November 2024 at 14:17,"Because the VAST majority of MAGAts have proven they are unwilling to have intellectual conversations. They along with their sweaty tryhard nerd Elon ruined twitter.

5112,21 November 2024 at 14:20,"For people who left X/Twitter,
This is what you're missing out on👇🏽
A cesspool of hate!"

Abusive and death-worshipping

by labeling positive.
 Something they may not have experienced for years."

5115,21 November 2024 at 09:21,"It depends. I don’t mind Trump supporters as long as they respect our opinions. If they disagree, they can scroll past, as I would. But I feel that some come to spread misinformation/disinformation, troll, argue without purpose, or insult others.

Isn’t that why we left X for a new platform? (1/4)"
5116,21 November 2024 at 12:52,Welcome to Bluesky! I left X-Twitter back in July! This is a more pleasant and accepting space. Bit like Greenbelt itself...

He owned you. Not me."
5121,21 November 2024 at 17:21,"That's the problem, Rodrigo! Takes too much time to properly monitor 2 accounts as I'm finding. I do think if the main UK orchestras & other musicians moved here than I could close X. Sadly very few have left X but those that have are now spread over numerous sites."

5125,15 November 2024 at 16:16,"I am new here. I stopped using Facebook a year ago & left X 3 weeks ago. I refuse to support anything run by anyone who supports or cow-tows to the Orange Narcissist.  
I am hoping there are more level headed, civil people here & praying it's not full of hate & fake accounts trying to friend me."
5126,15 November 2024 at 16:09,I just left x I couldn’t take the narcissism and the hate posts. We are in this world together and for me it’s easier to be nice than a hateful person.

5128,15 November 2024 at 15:48,"So I left X today, I really wasn't an active user, and I was recently on to see what was gaping in the election.  Due to new user updates and it's just doom scrolling I had to leave.  I truly hope that this will be a place of truth and respect."
5129,15 November 2024 at 16:12,Yup. I left X a couple months and today is my first day on Bluesky.
5130,15 November 2024 at 21:49,"Normally, there’s some buffer time in between leaving an old app and starting a new one. But y’all have not only left X, but deleted your accounts with the quickness!"

5132,15 November 2024 at 21:43,I left X because it became so ugly and nasty. Joining Bluesky feels like I can breath and not worry that someone will call me a name or hurt my feelings. Penny is happy to be here as well. I just need a safe space to breath and not worry about what this country is becoming. Thank you
5133,15 November 2024 at 20:13,Owens left X. Hope you enjoyed your performative politics.
5134,15 November 2024 at 20:02,"I'm sorry, I understand what it means to have a peaceful environment. I left X in June bc of that. Just keep speaking up, hopefully remind folks. Hopefully, u still get ur peace. I do enjoy politics but respectful. Try removing politics as a topic of interest.Maybe it will filter out. Wish the best."

5139,15 November 2024 at 22:47,I left X awhile back and no regrets. I hope Blue Sky is here to stay. And Musk doesn’t buy it..
5140,15 November 2024 at 14:27,"I bet when they’re all alone on their site all they’ll still ever have to talk about is  ‘all the pussies that left X’ .
They can always just look at the Temu (Chinese company) ads and porn bots."

5145,21 November 2024 at 22:54,"Cancel all subscriptions to these papers and cut the cable. 

Many people have just come here from X after the election when they should have left X a year ago. Don't be late to quit these shitty newspapers. Whatever they used to be is dead now."

5148,18 November 2024 at 22:34,I left X because we were being used a punching bags. I don't like Magas telling me I will be in a concentration camp by next Fall and I don't like having Magas threaten to come to my house and kill my family simply for not worshiping some Orange Rapist as a God.
5149,18 November 2024 at 22:28,💙follow me Brittney!!! I left X !!!

I don't think this sky will be blue indefinitely, but until then I will be able to keep my sanity while socializing a bit online while gathering more knowledge!"
5169,26 November 2024 at 03:27,Wow… you left X because of the hate you say is being spewed. But yet here you are shaming and making fun of someone where you have no evidence that what you are saying is truth. Thus you are participating in hate speech and misinformation. What  hypocrisy 👁️👄👁️

5213,24 November 2024 at 17:40,I literally left X and stopped reading the news so I wouldn’t have to see another picture of this guy…
5214,24 November 2024 at 22:55,Before I left X I was commenting to a friend of mine how normalized going out and getting shitfaced has become. A few people I followed only had stories of themselves out getting plastered. It’s quite sad
5215,24 November 2024 at 23:13,I’ve just left X. It was long overdue. This is my first post here. Feeling better already. Still exploring.

5220,26 November 2024 at 00:32,I left X couple weeks ago . So glad I did should have sooner . Until you leave you do not realize how toxic that app is to your well being . I never engaged in the hate  but just seeing it over and over is toxic !

5222,26 November 2024 at 00:46,It does not matter where you hide ken penders the real reason you left x was to hide for your crimes. You are going to jail for being a child pedohile like Chris Chan. You are also going to prison for perjury and being a theif for stealing sega’s characters that belong to them.
5223,27 November 2024 at 10:47,No need to apologise! Engagement is what it's all about and why I joined twitter a few years and the lack of it was one of the many reasons I left X
5224,27 November 2024 at 12:30,"Eliot, you left X-Twitter on 11/19/24 and your Bluesky was at 9.3k. (Yes, I looked, lol) 
We need a way to celebrate when you reach 77.8k. 

How do we do that?

A live you-tube show that’s announced to Bluesky followers?"

5259,23 November 2024 at 16:17,I left X
5260,23 November 2024 at 20:50,what is the concensus - I left X a few days ago and just saw a BSKY app to help me locate all my X followers here.  Should we abandon X altogether or save they log in so people can't impersonate you?
5261,23 November 2024 at 21:11,"I said my goodbye to twitter, left X and now enjoying my time in BlueSky."
5262,23 November 2024 at 21:12,Left X over a week ago and it felt cleansing and refreshing. It is no longer possible to speak freely there without fear of being doxxed by Musk who could expose anyone at any time. Also nice that MAGA has almost nobody to troll and the bots are posting to the abyss.
5263,23 November 2024 at 20:14,"I hate Elon, so I left X for BluSky. It's that simple."
5264,23 November 2024 at 20:41,Perhaps one of the things I missed when I left X was these guys and their illusive Canberra! Happy to see them here! 👏
5265,23 November 2024 at 22:42,Idk what's going on but posting someone's child for all to see is reckless. You could've cropped her out frfr. Ish like this on my tl is why I left X
5266,23 November 2024 at 22:08,"Bluesky was weird at first, but I liked its original Twitter feel. 
I joined well before the election but I couldn’t get any traction with it and it was inundated with cartoon images. 

Post election and loads of people left X for BSky and made it into a great platform."
5267,23 November 2024 at 22:02,"Thank you for the gift article. Reading this I wish I left X sooner. Anything to watch the right along with Trump, Musk, the GQP and MAGA implode is wonderful…"
5268,23 November 2024 at 22:10,"Reason I left X was people’s hard right support of Fascism and their downright rudeness, crudeness & bad language, as well as lies. Let’s call ‘misinformation’ what it really is, in blunt language, falsehoods & lies."

 Or did he have a problem?"

The thing is though, these people do it, because, even if they cannot accept it, they love any services they can make money from. Why they haven't really left X if they didnt used that🤣🤣🤣?"

The sad cowards who thrive in anonymity."

5355,22 November 2024 at 16:32,This is exactly type of comment magas would make on X. Which I is why I left X two yeara ago. I thought this site was going to more about discussions rather than sniping from the left. You and others have turned BlueSky into a mirror image of X but from the left. Thanks.☹️
5356,22 November 2024 at 17:22,"I left X months before the election not for a protected echo chamber, but rather because my feed on X had slowly morphed into ads and clickbait that held no value for me.

5376,27 November 2024 at 17:40,Nothing to do with taking it on X. Rightwing nutjobs on X were literally being busted for being paid by Russia to perpetuate the propagandous rhetoric you’re spewing right now. You sheep are a cancer and everywhere. I left X to boycott musk.  Don’t support rape enablers.

But if enough people leave, X becomes irrelevant. Let Elon and his fanbois tweet at each other while decent people converse here."
5387,2 December 2024 at 02:03,Just the ones who left X because their feelings got hurt. This is fun all you sad people are here. I'm telling Elon so he can buy this.

5404,28 November 2024 at 20:57,"Then why are you here, Nazi? To annoy the left and try to make yourself relevant because they all left X? No one else to belittle and be condescending to? What a life to live."
5405,28 November 2024 at 17:48,"So far.  I would block around ⅓ of the accounts that tried to follow me on X.  I left X the day after the election.  Since then, I’ve been blocking about 1/5 of the accounts that try to follow me here."
5406,28 November 2024 at 19:40,"This is the behavior I left X for Tom. 
My og reply was suggesting statements were stale but the electorate has been manipulated (polls,msm).
Your reply talked about cpc  and their slogans.  
Nothing about my reply.  
My confusion was understandable. Your mocking isn't."
5407,28 November 2024 at 17:06,I would prefer not to see his messages posted here. That’s why I left X and never on his site either.
5408,29 November 2024 at 00:47,Black people left x but brought the anti black racism with them...in their souls
5409,29 November 2024 at 05:44,"I dislike Zuckerberg, but 2 years ago Musk went full Nazi, & I couldn't stay any longer. I tried Post & Mastadon, which sucked, so when 🧵started, I left X. It's great compared to X. We kept MAGA off of there. It's mostly Democrats, friendly people, & it's good for writing/editing longer posts."
5410,29 November 2024 at 04:25,"Thanks why I left X, and came here!  Our community will be heard on Bluesky!!!📣 Have a good evening Seanpal!"
5411,29 November 2024 at 04:24,"God. Get a life. I left X when he took over. And I’m an atheist. 
Seems like you never left and are gonna stay there. I’m over your account. Done."
5412,28 November 2024 at 21:31,"Your second sentence is a dang good point - and a useful distinction. People joined Twitter, people /left/ X. Referring to it as 'Twitter' for the good stuff and 'X' for the <poop emoji> it became is immensely fitting."
5413,28 November 2024 at 21:37,Please go away. I left X partly to get away from your screaming.
5414,29 November 2024 at 19:34,"Hi Gwen. I left x too!  I’m originally from PA, now in NC."
5415,29 November 2024 at 18:54,"@unlincoln.bsky.social
 get to posting.
We all left X"
5416,29 November 2024 at 19:20,"If you haven’t left X for good by now, I’m not sure if you are truly just not full of piss."
5417,29 November 2024 at 18:52,idk i think it should be something someone personally chooses instead of being forced to have that on automatically. especially bc a lot of people left X for its sucky algorithm
5418,29 November 2024 at 19:37,Just left X and joined here seems so much better already 👍
5419,29 November 2024 at 18:06,"Yes, I only found her profile, after I posted, otherwise I would have tagged her. Although she put tagging off in LinkedIn and Facebook and recently, I also couldn't tag her in X - I think she left X."
5420,29 November 2024 at 18:33,I think that the reason people left X is because they couldn't block or ignore conservative viewpoints.  So with that in mind I think the left would just ignore and block the person because they can.
5421,29 November 2024 at 16:42,"Ever since I left X I have started to get Elmo emails selling products. Blocked!
So guess he took my email from my inactive account."
5422,29 November 2024 at 16:08,"STOP FEEDING THE TROLL.

Seriously though, just stop it.

I left X to get away from EM.

Enough already."
5423,29 November 2024 at 16:17,"Particularly about the UK. He knows nothing apart from tabloid headlines (aimed at adults with a reading age of 11 years old) that he seems to be happy to read uncritically.
I'm not particularly proud of the UK, but I am of many things, such as our NHS. I find his stupid posts upsetting. So I left X"
5424,29 November 2024 at 20:14,I see you left X because everyone called you out on your BS. Are you still selling your kids' stuff for drugs.
5425,5 December 2024 at 03:08,"Left x several months ago, not missing the noise one bit. Still getting used to Bluesky interface."
5426,5 December 2024 at 00:44,"Same here!! So happy that I left ""X""."
5427,5 December 2024 at 01:38,The day I left X forever I saw a post by John Rich threatening that Musk is definitely sharing all the names of people with trump who don't support him and we will all be punished for our comments. I definitely think about being a target for my posts even on this site. They are evil.
5428,4 December 2024 at 20:45,Hi there! So glad you have come over to bluer skies. I left X 1 week after the election… mainly because of Elon.
5429,4 December 2024 at 18:40,"I left X because if the death threats and the numerous scam artis harassment. Musk allows prostitutes to advertise while not allowing Nonprofits to advertise. 
This is a messed-up industry.  I came to Bluesky in hope of finding peace amongst good people."
5430,4 December 2024 at 19:21,"First, the bot seems racist.
I left X with the crowd a few weeks ago and noticed the rolls here swelling with questionable accounts.  
Whether the motive is sales or scam or just to irritate people, it is logical that they would flock where the people are."
5431,4 December 2024 at 19:32,I've already said why. I'm here temporarily to make fun of fussy blue haired communists who left X bc they can't stand not having complete control over the content of a social media platform.
5432,4 December 2024 at 22:26,"Thank fuck they’re here.

I have to suspect that Co-President Musk will run most of the mainline accounts that haven’t already left X off as soon as he can physically manage."
5433,4 December 2024 at 15:08,"I left X today after Agent Orange's win, and for the first time, my headaches are GONE!  Yeah!!!👍"
5434,4 December 2024 at 22:42,"I left X today after Agent Orange's win, and for the first time, my headaches are GONE!  Yeah!!!👍"
5435,4 December 2024 at 21:35,"I've been here for a couple of weeks. I'm glad I left X. I absolutely despise Musk, and MAGA."
5436,4 December 2024 at 20:52,If any of my X followers are her in Bluesky please join me in this new space. I’ve left X in disgust
5437,4 December 2024 at 20:55,New here.  Left X 2 years ago but love the idea of not being slapped with hate and intentional ignorance daily! Anyone else?
5438,4 December 2024 at 07:31,What??? I thought we left X to get away from censorship?
5439,4 December 2024 at 12:45,After 15 years I left X and will not look back...
5440,4 December 2024 at 02:55,"@nealkatyal.bsky.social

5441,4 December 2024 at 02:44,"@sencruz.bsky.social
 what the hell are you doing here? We left X to get away from people like you. MAGAt Zombies that worship at the alter of Trump. No algorithms here to switch the screens to your conspiracy theories and lies. This is Musk Trump free zone. Not controlling like X."
5442,4 December 2024 at 04:50,"I admire how he quickly left X after the Twitter transfer. It was painful to miss his posts, but it's commendable. Bagley has character."
5443,4 December 2024 at 10:55,"Many European universities show leadership by having left X. This doesn't seem to be the case with Danish universities (including mine), who are still fine associating themselves with the platform's right-wing and anti-science extremism 🤷"
5444,3 December 2024 at 14:57,"I joined Bluesky just over 2 weeks ago!  Hoping to reconnect with my lovely reading/writing friends who left X & to make new connections with fellow readers & writers here.  I appreciate all  followers, new & old, I've connected with so far! Here's my Bella to welcome you!

5445,3 December 2024 at 15:04,"I think X is going to take real hit in next 3 years. Unless Musk cuts down on Botnet's that are all over place, it will be more AIish driven content than actual people posting. I left X primary not because of politics, though it did play a role, but prevented feed seeing anything but politics. /1"
5446,3 December 2024 at 18:57,Left X yesterday.  This is currently on X with my old bio.  There are a half dozen of them apparently bits.  But my name and bio.
5447,3 December 2024 at 18:22,This is a perfect example of why I left X.
5448,3 December 2024 at 18:16,We all left X. We are here. Is it as easy as all clicking on APNews.com and not on NYTimes dot com?
5449,3 December 2024 at 19:35,Seeing a lot of variants on this lately. For any MAGA folk reading: we left X & many of us are blocking you here bc Free Speech also means we're not REQUIRED to listen to bullshit takes & offensive language or look at memes that aren't funny. You're free to keep screeching into the void without us.
5450,3 December 2024 at 19:19,"Honestly no idea. This a personal account for me, and I left X for very personal reasons. I haven't talked to our community/PR folks about this platform specifically. Sorry for the unhelpful answer!"
5451,3 December 2024 at 20:15,Have you left X?   It seems nice here!
5452,3 December 2024 at 20:04,It is great to reconnect with you. I left X in the dustbin of time.
5453,3 December 2024 at 19:54,I left X because I got tired of ignorant stupidity
5454,3 December 2024 at 17:07,"The biggest reason I left X/Twitter is because  I really can't  stand Elon Musk. It's  his right to support  felon and cheeseburger aficionado  Trump, but people like him should be vetted for common sense. Am I Right?"
5455,3 December 2024 at 18:20,I left X 10 days ago. Deleted.
5456,5 December 2024 at 07:50,"On the other hand the mini was so good my internet use probably went up so I am somewhat hoping having a slightly inconveniently large iPhone will help with the cutting back. Tho ever since I left X the everything app, like 60% of my negative feelings about phones have gone away"
5457,5 December 2024 at 06:55,"I think I’m gonna make it a point to unfollow accounts that are too politically charged. I left x because you can’t let politics consume life. It’s important, but having your finger on that pulse all day is…. Not healthy. Find a news source you like and be curious."
5458,5 December 2024 at 06:56,"I left X Jenny, it'd be nice to get that link info without having to go on that toxic platform again."
5459,5 December 2024 at 07:02,"Sad to see. 
It’s the kind of crap people left X (Twitter) to avoid. Doesn’t matter which side of the political fence you are, life is so much better without this kind of nonsense.
Hardly famous words of wisdom, just plain hate at the end of the day."
5460,3 December 2024 at 02:37,Aww you left X you poor little thing
5461,3 December 2024 at 02:47,"Everything happening now, at breakneck speed, requires a radical, gloves off, art of war approach. The GOP will destroy it all. I don’t know if that means civil war, or preferably civil divorce. Imagine if you cld just leave them the way we at BS left X. BS is the manifestation of a bigger desire."
5462,2 December 2024 at 22:32,"I left X the moment Elon Musk acquired Twitter because I’m not about supporting a misogynist with a hard for space travel and eugenics. 

I landed here to follow my husbands cool ass uncle who told me about it on Thanksgiving.

I’ve never voted for Trump and character counts can still kick rocks ✌🏼🏳️‍🌈💙"

5466,2 December 2024 at 16:59,"Helpful article, thanks! I personally left X because I just found posting on it was making me more stressed, not happier, always refreshing to see if my post had gotten likes and such. Plus Musk didn't help. I'm still undecided if Bluesky is going to be worthwhile or not."

3. Intrusive ads hard not to click accidentally 
4. Final straw: inability to properly block"
5529,1 December 2024 at 20:09,Left X because it's filled with troll bots. The dialogue died. It used to be about exchanging ideas. It's good to have a wide variety of ideologies. Not an echo chamber. That's what made is so amazing. Now comments are about trying to out nasty each other. No genuine thoughts. So it's kinda gross!

The thoughtful, funny, irreverent accounts I followed were inundated by blue checked trolls, my feed was swamped with the fevered hot takes of nutters, especially Elon’s—it became a hate filled experience.

Obnoxious people/posts are elevated above all else. There is no real “debate” taking place there."

We get it, you think leftists are stupid."

I left X because of the vitriol and corrosiveness offered to me in the algorithm. Since migrating here, I feel emotionally better and not as worried. 

Keep up with the positive posts."

I'm sure all of us who left X didn't want those who work at X to lose their jobs or innocent Russian citizens to suffer when Russia was sanctioned.

5571,30 November 2024 at 23:45,I left X well over a year ago because not being able to block out their abuse and having Musky manipulate the trends to encourage more toxic engagement was effecting my over all health. Many can't see just how toxic it really was. I truly enjoy the space I made for myself here.😊
5572,30 November 2024 at 23:32,I have left X forever

5579,1 December 2024 at 01:42,I had 450 followers on X but I left it because almost no one engaged my tweets. It was like I was talking to myself. So I had no feedback. If I get no feedback how do I know anyone is helped with my posts? I left X and the account must have been flagged because it's gone.

5583,30 November 2024 at 16:33,I know a lot of upset liberals left X and felt they didn't get a fair shake. Wanted you to know that there's people out there that appreciate your efforts and would like to present to you a participation ribbon for the election. You tried.
5584,1 December 2024 at 05:03,Not one specifically but I’m super happy that a lot of my big account X refugee favorites are here and a few have followed me back. It’s so nice to be able to read their posts again with all the trash. I left X in 2023 so I missed them.
5585,30 November 2024 at 11:13,So many good people have left 'X' (and all RW views are promoted by Musk) that disgusting hate filled views are becoming the 'Norm' there. People who don't understand this are misguided into believing that Racism + Fascism is just 'A point of view' (and Reform/Tories might win)🤣
5586,30 November 2024 at 10:43,This is one of the reasons I left X
5587,30 November 2024 at 10:35,I left X after somebody used the sentence “Well Elon Musk doesn’t believe in climate change and he’s a rocket scientist” in an argument with me. And I just gave up.
5588,30 November 2024 at 10:10,Have done just that. I left X to get away from toxic fascists and they are popping up their nasty little heads on here now.☹️

5591,5 December 2024 at 14:29,"This is exactly why I left X. Those incantations repeated every day do not make them real.

5782,6 August 2024 at 00:09,"I’ve left X I’m sick of the nastiness the far right algorithms pumping Nazi rhetoric on your time lines

5783,7 August 2024 at 17:44,So pleased you’re sharing here. Left X today. Hoping the posts I value emerge here too.
5784,6 July 2024 at 22:44,"Nah Jack who was one of the board members left X. I’m thinking there is no love
Lost  there 💜"
5785,7 July 2024 at 00:48,"I left 400,000 tweets and 5,000 followers and networks behind when I left X after ACT doxxed me twice there and once on LinkedIn durring the campaign

Had to rebuild from scratch here and reinforce security on LinkedIn"
5786,23 August 2024 at 07:14,I feel X doesn't need to leave UK -> UK has already left X 🙃
5787,19 August 2024 at 07:43,"Hi Sunder, I left X last week but I hope you have posted this up there. X is evidently turning racism and hate into a profitable business for any individual. This is desperate and dangerous. Hopefully your post will persuade companies to leave and regulators to prosecute.

5788,21 August 2024 at 09:33,"Left X 6 months ago due to the uncontrolled trolling and threatening messages to female Irish politicians. Horrific stuff. Just hope to read about current affairs, dogs, gardening and anything weird that might help us smile. Hi all!"
5789,18 August 2024 at 19:33,"@bjhulse.bsky.social
 Hi, Barbara. Have you now left ""X""? Just so I know where to send any posts! 🤣"
5790,17 August 2024 at 00:29,"Wow, this is exactly the kind of support I was hoping to find here! This is why I left X. The vitriol was getting so crazy over there. Thank you!"
5791,17 August 2024 at 10:37,"Welcome, Johnny!👋 It surely is amazing. Left X last October and lovin’ it here! Thank you for the follow. Happy to follow back. 😊"
5792,17 August 2024 at 23:17,"I have joined Bluesky because I have left ""X"", having put up with its owner's support for hate filled posts and untruths in the name of ""free speech""."
5793,17 August 2024 at 21:11,"Hi everyone, reuploading my art to sites like BlueSky and Threads and Cara makes me wanna die but I want to be more active because I've lost contact with so many people who've left X and are now active here... I hate how fragmented the art community has become :("
5794,11 September 2024 at 23:45,"Please come to this or threads, many left X because of Musk."
5795,13 September 2024 at 00:23,"for years this story would have ended there, with my own showing of superiority to calm my anxiety

but

having left X-ianity, starting to unpack what from my past was helpful vs. harmful-

(alot more harm than anyone wants to admit)

-it needs to be mentioned how these folks viewed *neurodiversity*"
5796,10 September 2024 at 23:39,New people keep appearing it seems ...So a BIG welcome to all those who have finally left X  ...welcome to the friendly village we call BLUESKY 😉👍

5799,14 September 2024 at 15:18,I endorse and agree with this statement. I left X for these reasons and have brought my Department social media here as well.
5800,16 September 2024 at 08:56,It reminds me why I left X for...
5801,16 September 2024 at 16:00,"Today I officially left x. I remained only because most people are still there and you can witness 1st hand accounts of the most marginalized around the world. EM’s remarks have been particularly disgusting as of late. 

Anyway, here’s a photo of one of Dan Flavin’s pieces of art at Dia Beacon. 😍"
5802,17 September 2024 at 12:54,"That’s heartening 🤭 I felt like I was late to the par-tay, nice to know I was not as tardy as I felt 😹

Am glad that I did too 🤙🏼

You guys more than make up for “what was lost” 🔥🦋🩵

Y’ALL da Best"
5803,15 September 2024 at 20:54,You was so missed when you left X 🥺🙏🏼 but your here now 🤗🧡🙏🏼
5804,21 September 2024 at 15:34,"Absolutely, and one of the reasons I haven’t left X yet. We had a feedback form after the BAS conference and I suggested a presence on here, we’ll see what happens."
5805,19 September 2024 at 21:15,I haven't had one death threat since I left X
5806,25 September 2024 at 06:21,🚨🚨 I think this is a key point by Roland Smith. If this site is to survive and thrive we all need to engage and encourage each other a bit more. You do not need to repost everything but we can surely do better than this (also pointing to myself who just left X and have no intention on returning).
5807,24 September 2024 at 12:54,"yeah, I applied for a carer's assessment (where they look at your situation and see if there's some way to get help) in May and then finally started it.
Can't remember how far things were when I left X but mom's in the nursing home, still hallucinating, dad and sister both need a lot of help atm"

5809,23 September 2024 at 20:08,"Before I left X, if I tweeted ""peace"", the echo was ""hate"". Is that what they mean?"
5810,22 September 2024 at 18:36,"I left X because it felt like an echo chamber for Nazi’s and crypto bros. My life is not worse off without their viewpoints being put constantly on my my feed. If you feel uncomfortable without people expressing those views, there are other places you can get that. You are not forced to be here."
5811,4 October 2024 at 09:07,"I left X for Bluesky. Best decision I made. It's much more chill here.

Still disappointing to see what's happening with FA."
5812,14 October 2024 at 16:33,I left X before then app went down in BR so I wouldn’t go back to it either way
5813,16 October 2024 at 03:11,Ever wonder why I left X?
5814,16 October 2024 at 15:05,"Welcome. I left X for the same reason as well as the awful hate speech, which was allowed. Feels safe here"
5815,17 October 2024 at 15:36,Left X and coming here is so much better
5816,18 October 2024 at 03:10,Same. That’s why I left X a long time ago. Only used it for reposts and small interactions on dms but that’s just it.
5817,18 October 2024 at 19:58,Loving all the art I'm seeing over the past few days. It's one of the things I missed seeing when I left X.
5818,18 October 2024 at 20:06,I left X so I can't answer that.
5819,18 October 2024 at 22:00,Fabulous photo...glad I found you over here now. I left X cesspit sometime ago and missed your postings.
5820,18 October 2024 at 18:51,"Just wanted to share that I have officially left X (Twitter) due to the recent changes. 

The new block policies made me feel unsafe, especially as someone who is still dealing with a cyberstalker.

Has anyone else decided to leave the platform for this reason?"
5821,8 October 2024 at 18:30,Am I glad I left X!!
5822,12 October 2024 at 19:05,Finally left X this week after 15 years.  Hardly checked it all since Muskrat took over.  Just no fun there anymore.
5823,20 October 2024 at 17:38,"Honestly, I wouldn’t be mad if it did. I left X on Jan 1 and haven’t looked back. If insta continues to be dumb, I may just make Bluesky my permanent solo home. At least I can post body and sex positive content here!"
5824,18 October 2024 at 00:34,"You're right, that's the sweetest! I also wanted to tell you how happy I am to see you, I haven't seen you since I left X. It's so good to see you again!💙🫂"
5825,18 October 2024 at 08:10,"Saw a lot of people left x, yep, not gonna waste a second in that shithole. But once the popularity of this website skyrockets, I’m afraid that the rage baits, ads, and all those brain-rot bullshits are all coming back. All I can say is enjoy it to the fullest we can."
5826,19 October 2024 at 21:25,"Been waiting for increase in activity from accounts like yours here. Left X in the summer. Sick and tired of all the right wing propaganda accounts being boosted in my feed, and the only one interacting with my account was xxx accounts"
5827,26 October 2024 at 13:19,"Yay!  Great to see you here on BlueSky; I haven't heard from you since I left X-Twitter! Looking forward to seeing more Rae the Doe and the terrible puns that I crave!

5830,6 November 2024 at 14:17,"Look after yourself Kaiser.  And yeah, I left X too today.  It's for the best.

Twitter died a long time ago and all that's left are these vultures feeding off it's corpse."
5831,6 November 2024 at 13:56,"Officially left X, fuck that place. And what in the actual fuck just happened here? Legit scared as a gay man that immigrated to the US. No idea what this new administration will do to me and folks like me. It's truly scary."
5832,6 November 2024 at 15:41,I would be one that left X

5834,23 October 2024 at 22:06,"Also going to say this, if the only reason that you left X is because of Elon, fine, but don’t dehumanize those who will still use X because you don’t like someone, that’s SUPER weird."
5835,24 October 2024 at 16:53,"Oh, as soon as I saw that starting to pop up on my feed, I took permeative action lol

I don’t want that kind of stuff getting more engagement because then it’ll take root and end up like we never left X"
5836,30 October 2024 at 17:52,Left X last week. Hope this place doesn't turn out like that
5837,31 October 2024 at 00:13,Wow…on here one day and have already had a Trump supporter messaging me their BS propaganda. I left X to get away from that garbage.
5838,29 October 2024 at 00:39,"It's a long and difficult process to get people to leave one of the largest social media platforms in the world. As of Sept 2024, only 20% of users in the US had left X. Simply not enough to abandon the platform during an election in which the future of American democracy is at stake."
5839,21 October 2024 at 10:24,"I just left X last night.
Musk's getting desperate, tweeting all sorts of false information to mislead voters."
5840,21 October 2024 at 02:21,"It's MAGAnificent.☺️We don't tolerate Nazi's here. We've heard all the free speech crap about how we have to listen to their abuse and no, no we don't. Being forced to watch MAGA constantly attack us with their free hate speech and not being allowed to block them is why we left  X in the first place."
5841,22 October 2024 at 13:32,"I go touch grass for a few months and everyone has left X and flooded into here because Elon was trying to use artists work for AI models.

How can people say AI tech is bad for the world when it got everyone to leave x lol"
5842,22 October 2024 at 14:40,I finally left X last night because Twitter sold me to Musk.

not saying I'm better than anyone I've posted like 12000 xeets since you left x dot com"
5844,22 October 2024 at 20:50,Personnally i have left X ans deleted my account.
5845,23 October 2024 at 00:27,"That's a great idea! I almost want to sign back up for an account on ""X"" just to do that. I probably won't (not worth it for me.) Still, great idea for those who haven't left ""X"" yet."
5846,23 October 2024 at 08:40,"I left X a few days ago.
Every other post is Musk pushing hard for Trump to win the election.
 The fake news he's promoting is nauseating."
5847,7 November 2024 at 17:04,Hello all! I left X today. Looking forward to beginning to explore this site!
5848,7 November 2024 at 17:45,"I don't care. I'm here to share my thoughts and feelings because it's my therapy.

6209,13 November 2024 at 13:21,Hello!! I just left X .  Excited to be here!! Anyone else leave X???
6210,13 November 2024 at 13:19,"I just left ""X"" and am new to Bluesky.  I heard an interview on Sirius POTUS channel that gave me an ""aha"" moment.  The interviewee said if you're still on ""X"" then you are complicit to Musk and his ways.  I am not- so I left."
6211,13 November 2024 at 15:01,"My friend, great to connect with you and D again here. I trust you and your family are doing very well indeed.
I should have left X long ago. I bemoan the results of your recent election and the consequences for years to come.
The musk-trump alliance - just evil and deplorable."
6212,16 November 2024 at 14:36,"Hi Lynne!
I left X months ago"
6213,16 November 2024 at 14:36,"Hey Bluesky! 👋🏻 I’m Cody—project manager, mental health advocate, policy researcher, marathoner, and lover of Italian food. 

I left X for a fresh, positive space and am here for all the good vibes, learning, and connection.

6216,13 November 2024 at 17:08,"Well, maybe since they’re getting more people maybe they’ll improve this app I’ve been on it a few days now I and over 1 million people left X and I think they joined bluesky so more people using it the better it will get. Not sure if anybody else sees  this because I don’t have any followers."
6217,14 November 2024 at 12:15,"Over a million users have left X, welcome to Bluesky.

6221,16 November 2024 at 21:47,"Thanks for being here. Yes, even us, leftist soyboys who left X, need our daily serving of knuckle sandwich buffets 😂"
6222,16 November 2024 at 21:53,I left X completely.  I like BlueSky so much better.  I have the app on my phone but I took the other apps off.  It’s been nice.  I’m still trying to reduce my social media time. I’m seeing a lot of improvement.
6223,16 November 2024 at 21:33,"Great to have 
@theanfieldwrap.bsky.social
 & contributors make the move over here. As a 
#LFC

6225,16 November 2024 at 19:44,"Greetings to all. I just left X.
Wondering how many of my following friends are here. I had 2,900 but when I left went down to 1700.
I you all are here love to follow you back."
6226,16 November 2024 at 18:09,Boss isn’t on Bluesky though should’ve left X forever ago might not be losing my job by 2025
6227,20 November 2024 at 08:29,"I left X a long long time ago. The ""coming over here"" bit needed more critical mass for me to bother."
6228,20 November 2024 at 14:57,"BLUESKY is supposed to be a new platform for all the LIBERALS who left ""X"" because it refuses to CENSOR conservative views...

Wake up Liberals...  Conservatives will follow you wherever you go and/or try to HIDE...

This is America, freedom of speech is a BITCH"
6229,20 November 2024 at 19:42,I dont do DM’s and I left “X” 3 yrs ago
6230,20 November 2024 at 20:28,"I know all of you Never Trumpers left X for this platform. I am not here to insult anyone, just educate.
Trump Won, with over 50% of the vote. He has the, Presidency,House, and Senate. I am thrilled. I was once cancelled but now I am not. Elections have circumstances. Stealing Elections too!!!"
6231,20 November 2024 at 20:37,There are some seriously sick people migrating here. The moderators will be working overtime. I left X when the First Lady bought it but I had no idea the depths of depravity that lurked there until I saw the post of a seriously deranged person who made their way over here.
6232,20 November 2024 at 20:30,Subscribe to mute or block the kind of accounts U left X to avoid
6233,20 November 2024 at 17:40,"I am a progressive technocrat, one cannot get much more progressive than that....

@bsky.app

6237,20 November 2024 at 19:44,I’m just blocking them. I left X to get away from their negativity and cruelty.
6238,20 November 2024 at 20:08,"I’m sure that guys is on Truth Social or whatever it’s called and only watches Fox. 

If he wants to preach about the echo chamber he should be talking to Trumps cult who only watch Fox. 

I left X because Elon’s agenda is clear and the algorithm is bananas."
6239,20 November 2024 at 20:03,Hang on moderate your language. I left X to get away from the hate. Just calm down everything is ok.
6240,20 November 2024 at 21:23,"I speak for me. I have left X because I think it is not acceptable that the owner of a social network, that uses it to manipulate and generate hate and misinformation (OK ""not yesterday""), becomes now a government official (in the US)."

6246,20 November 2024 at 14:18,"Hi, yes! We work together in real life! She's fantastic. She's the one who talked me into migrating. I left X way back when. And I like scrolling Instagram but I didn't actually meet people!"
6247,20 November 2024 at 13:11,Thank you. I’m trying to grow my followers. I lost thousands of followers when I left X.
6248,20 November 2024 at 16:00,"I read the news that lots of people left X and joined Bluesky after the election. I had never heard of Bluesky before, I decided to check it out."

6252,20 November 2024 at 16:47,"I was thinking. You along with me and millions of others left X....

X is now the dark side, Sith

BlueSky is the Jedi side.

Too much???? 😞"

Happy to see you here, too!"
6256,21 November 2024 at 00:24,this is explicit. 😂 i left x for a reason.
6257,21 November 2024 at 00:50,"Good investigative article.  So many troll accounts on x platform that between all the troll groups that harass and threaten, Russian and maga bots being the worst, I left x.  There seems to be some x bots that just joyfully sing the praises and love of musk … so it seems he uses bots too."
6258,20 November 2024 at 22:49,"So many of these are skewed. 
There’s a LOT of people like me who barely go on FB or IG and talk about politics. 
I only go on FB to say Happy Birthday to people & have zero interest in IG or threads. See a pattern? I hate Zuck.
Left X after a Nazi took over."
6259,20 November 2024 at 22:58,Were you forced to click my profile where the content is or are you harassing me for telling people I’m a sex worker??? Be FR. You dont like to see sex workers you can BLOCK people that express that they are. I dont care for an apology from someone who is quick to do the same thing people left x for
6260,20 November 2024 at 23:55,Wow. 😮 That platform is ridiculous at times. I remember seeing you deactivate. I’m glad you put your peace first and left X behind.
6261,20 November 2024 at 23:32,"""Can we even call them human beings at this point?""

Let me guess...you left X because of all the hate.
What a shame you brought it with you."
6262,20 November 2024 at 23:52,"@bsky.app
 hi Finally left X which has been reduced to a cesspool of rightwing fanatism and misinformation and delusional Jesus freaks …not sure how this works here but hoping to find a home for honest dialogue"

6265,21 November 2024 at 00:10,Congratulations! I left x for good today. It's a great feeling!
6266,21 November 2024 at 02:05,"Dr. Jordan Peterson did a whole video clinically psychoanalyzing Trump, Musk, RFK, Gabbard, and called them the X Men. Let’s hope for QUALIFIED professionals to discuss. I left X after that."

6268,19 November 2024 at 23:59,Left X last week and happy on Threads but expanding my horizons!  Where are all my peeps at?
6269,20 November 2024 at 03:54,I left X when Neon Noodles bought it! It lost something that made it unique.

6276,19 November 2024 at 21:30,"You people want to lecture about freedom of speech, but y’all left X in favor for this app. Looks like y’all cant handle free speech if it goes against your viewpoint."
6277,19 November 2024 at 20:58,I left X/Twitter the day after Musk purchased it and never looked back.
6278,19 November 2024 at 20:43,"I left X because I seen that twat jumping on a stage. The US is a pretty shit country. Weird. But there are a lot of decent people there as well, not nearly enough as it turns out. We need the US to keep the orcs squared away in their own land!"

6289,18 November 2024 at 23:36,"I’m really not arguing anything. Just asking questions! 

I left X (Twitter) to learn and have productive conversations from smart people who also despise Donald Trump and the MAGA movement.

My policy on here is just going to block that stuff as soon as I see it"
6310,18 November 2024 at 22:41,Managed to sign in to this site today after a few technical issues.  Left X unannounced the day after US election hunting out those I used to follow & perhaps used to follow me.
6311,18 November 2024 at 22:45,POV you are looking for your friends who left X
6312,18 November 2024 at 23:59,"I left X.   Deactivated and deleted. 
Are you keeping yours?"

@justplainbeaute.bsky.social
. It’s been like mourning a loved one, not to mention missing those who left X immediately after the election. So I understand completely. I couldn’t let go of my SM community that quickly. Miss you daily. ❤️🕊️😘 🐕"
6315,21 November 2024 at 17:48,I have essentially left X completely. I am no longer posting or engaging there... I would delete my account if Taylor Nation and Taylor came here though 👀
6316,21 November 2024 at 17:48,"People left X/Twitter, but all I see are posts about X/Twitter😭. Can y'all leave y'all abusive br/gf behind . I know it's hard, but......"
6317,21 November 2024 at 19:48,"I never left X.
The funny thing is that my device allows me to be on both🙀"
6318,21 November 2024 at 19:54,"I so missed your quick and insightful postings, very infornative as always. 
Glad you left X too.😃"
6319,21 November 2024 at 09:44,"I had to leave work to care for him and we ended up renting out our home and moving back to family it destroyed our life,our families, our careers,our finances & there is no acknowledgement, no research,no effective treatment or ongoing support for the health problems. I left X months & months ago."
6320,21 November 2024 at 10:38,"Ah, a reminder why I left X behind. I guess it keeps him in people's minds and allows his hardcore following to continue frothing at the mouth."
6321,21 November 2024 at 10:55,"I left X because I was sick of the standard and unoriginal slurs. (Woke, loony lefty) Thrown around to stifle debate by people so fixed that it was pointless engaging, a big waste of our precious time."
6322,21 November 2024 at 11:00,Many of the Trump supporters simply want to insult. I am willing to converse with anyone that can talk civilly about a difference of opinion without profanity or name calling. I left X because of the ugliness of their rhetoric. I don’t want it here too. Most MAGA are not civil IMO.
6323,14 November 2024 at 11:24,Left X following Musk’s takeover. Can’t say I miss it - a cesspool of hate and unfettered racism. Seems I’m not alone in feeling this way.
6324,21 November 2024 at 22:36,"I’m on this platform because I got tired of having to block, filter and otherwise defend myself. Those Trump supporters only want to be here because we left X. They have no one left to bully."
6325,19 November 2024 at 00:58,I left X/Twitter the week Elon fired his content moderation staff. So glad we have this to replace it.
6326,19 November 2024 at 01:13,So many people are leaving X--but i left X before it even changed from Twitter. I think I am enjoying Blue Sky much more. More porn for starters and more adults.
6327,19 November 2024 at 01:44,"I understand what you mean, but let’s not bring that kind of stuff over to blue sky. We all left X because of it."
6328,19 November 2024 at 01:09,"Well, just made the leap and left X (Twitter)."
6329,19 November 2024 at 01:56,I honestly felt like X became more toxic. I deactivated my account and came on here. I know a bunch of people who already left X.
6330,19 November 2024 at 02:27,I block all MAGATS! I left X because of bots and MAGATS and I blocked them there but it was overwhelming. On Blue Sky they pop up a little and get blocked in a flash.
6331,18 November 2024 at 21:51,I have left X for good and think I like it here…hoping this can be my new home!
6332,18 November 2024 at 19:21,"When I left X I thought I was done with social media. But Bluesky feels lovely. Let’s keep it that way.

6333,19 November 2024 at 13:40,"I wasn't trying to. I'm not sure why any of you are trying to talk to us about any of this at all. We don't want to talk to you guys! That's the reason we left X, but here y'all come🙄 We just want to be left alone. You got what you wanted, now leave us alone✌🏽"

6335,19 November 2024 at 19:39,"Just to let you know, having this type of interchange with someone who is making definitive statements about a subject while being simultaneously unaware of basic information about the topic, and who is also unwilling to increase their knowledge is why I left X."
6336,19 November 2024 at 19:25,I left X and came here to find it's all Trump here too. Even if you follow other interests it seems Trump crap overwhelms all others.
6337,19 November 2024 at 19:16,All the degenerates and pedo’s left x too.
6338,19 November 2024 at 20:51,"Several of these entities, including McDonald's & Walmart contributed to Trump & while I'm glad they left X, I'm old enough to remember companies really only pausing their contributions to J6 supporting Pols."
6339,19 November 2024 at 18:50,"Same, although I left X 17 mo ago and never looked back, but yeah, same. Also like not having my preferred topics of interest hidden/reduced to match the site owner’s misguided ‘principles’. Lookin’ at YOU, Zuck. 👇👇👇"

6342,19 November 2024 at 20:47,"Ok let's get real about twitch. They hardly advertise anywhere, they expect us, their streamers, to do that for them. It's a big fault in their model. Now have a ton of us left X and don't advertise our streams there? Yup, but we never paid to do so anyways."
6343,19 November 2024 at 20:03,"Congratulations, joined you today left X , very happy with Bluesky"

6345,18 November 2024 at 21:50,Left X and using blue sky for the first time.
6346,19 November 2024 at 03:37,It is an echo chamber. You all left X so you could create a space where your opinions are never wrong. I give it 3 months before the perverted content starts to come to light.
6347,19 November 2024 at 03:59,"@jack-e-smith.bsky.social
  I'm glad I found you and blue sky, I was little sad when I left x account."
6348,19 November 2024 at 04:20,It’s not the quantity but the quality.  Thought leaders have left X for good.  And people are following.
6349,19 November 2024 at 09:05,"Less hate. Association with Elon Musk is too much. By posting in Bluesky, then copying a link to X your followers will move here too.  I receive your daily newsletter but I left X a long time ago. Now I can follow you here."
6350,19 November 2024 at 08:51,"Put my Bluesky on instagram with the caption “left X because of ya know… democracy” and someone replied saying “you’re one of them?!”

My guy, I’m an actor from South London that played an 83 year old man in a class last week before selling flowers at a Christmas market. 

…What were you expecting?"

1: Make new friends and post art
2: Instagram(Remi_coo), YouTube (Dani Mania) and Discord (Nostalgicremix)
3: No, I left X recently and have no plans to post there
4: Artworks, my crafts, life updates and rambles of my interests"
6352,20 November 2024 at 05:04,"Cool milestone. Please work on the hate speech here. I left X for the promise of artists and intellectuals, not to weather political junkies who hate everyone and anyone who doesn't agree with them. We can do better."
6353,20 November 2024 at 05:01,Totally agree! 🎉 Threads was so hard to grow on or find like-minded people. Bluesky’s feed already feels so much better. I left X/Twitter and haven’t looked back. I hope this keeps taking off! 🦋
6354,20 November 2024 at 05:20,"This HYPOCRITE is pretending like he's left X. So you think you have a right to be on both X and bluesky but those who disagree with you must only be on X?

I haven't left X yet, but my presence there was non-existent anyway so it's just a matter of time."
6359,20 November 2024 at 11:46,"Please don't bring Twitter, which is not Twitter. It's actually X, back here again. No one wants to see that no one wants to be a part of that. That is the whole reason why we left X was so that we didn't have to have comments from X so please don't bring it here. Thank you."
6360,20 November 2024 at 11:46,"🤣🤣🤣

Why are you here if you haven’t left X?

Is it because you can’t find enough people who won’t engage with you?

Musk will be most disappointed by your lack of commitment to support his platform."
6361,21 November 2024 at 05:09,"I left X because of the hate, but just lately I've seen more hate toward Trump and more hate toward Musk and hate hate hate... I don't care about your hate, I just wanna post shit and be happy."

I ""spoke"" to a guy who didn't want to leave X 'cause OBAMA followed him there! The struggle is real."
6364,21 November 2024 at 05:51,Left X for that exact reason. Let them get their likes and comments from vile people.
6365,21 November 2024 at 03:19,You left X because people you disagreed with were not being banned.

6369,21 November 2024 at 07:23,Yes I did! Left X Twitter completely. Not looking back! Bye Elon/Leon Muskrat!
6370,21 November 2024 at 07:58,"You may find that this is not the “teaser to justforfans/onlyfans” like X was - in fact, that kind of commercialization is a turn OFF here, because these are the people that left X because there was too much of that over there. 
People here for the person, not the image."

I have no qualms about blocking anyone that tries to bring that darkness here."
6376,20 November 2024 at 00:11,Why did you bring this shit to this platform is the same reason I left X.
6377,20 November 2024 at 00:28,Look like you Grifters are at it again.  You left “X” bc you couldn’t take the heat.  Have you decided what you next Grift will be? Asking for a friend🤣🤣🤣

6393,18 November 2024 at 12:34,I left X on Friday and thought it was all good. Realizing this somber morning that I don’t have my Bengals community. Any Cincinnati fans out there to commiserate with me? We are too close too often. It must be hard for Joey B to keep the faith. Wouldn’t blame Jamar and Trey if they wanted to leave🐅
6394,18 November 2024 at 12:23,I don’t know about everyone else but I was noticing that the people that I followed were posting and their posts weren’t showing up on my following feed.  As a consequence I had to go directly to their posts to see if they were still using X.   I thought that maybe they had already left X.

6420,17 November 2024 at 14:11,It's seriously not amusing. This was a safe space for the trans and queen community... it was OUR safest ace. Since last week high profile liberals have left X and come here WITHOUT ASKING. This is a problem because they brought their nazi terf trolls with them. It's no longer safe here
6421,17 November 2024 at 16:47,"A conservative friend why I left X.

I said: 

For years, you people claimed that the outgoing administration was ""controlling social media"", because they asked, nicely, that certain dangerous content be moderated.

X is literally owned and controlled by a member of the incoming administration..."

6484,17 November 2024 at 23:53,Left X for good
6485,18 November 2024 at 00:19,I’m not excited about joining this new platform. I left X two years ago and have been moving away from FB in the last six months. This is so refreshing.
6486,17 November 2024 at 19:12,"It's funny. I left X for very conservative reasons.

Like when crime and visible social disorder gets too high and you load a van and move to the burbs."
6487,17 November 2024 at 19:12,New here where are UFO peeps at add me 👽👽🤟just left x.
6488,17 November 2024 at 19:46,"I want to replace the X of joyful shitposting, friendship, bad puns, food, writing and art. I left X because that was being stifled. Personally I’m going to curate my feed so I never have to see politicians, and if that means blocking them, then I will."

6494,16 November 2024 at 16:31,Left “x” day after the election. I tried threads was not really jiving it so I heard my dems an swiftys are here. So here I am.
6495,16 November 2024 at 16:48,My first post. Just left X. So relieved. Here’s a nice starry image taken in the summer. To calm other X refugees.
6496,16 November 2024 at 16:48,"Hi world, I left X a while ago. Couldn't stand the idea of Musk running it."
6497,16 November 2024 at 16:43,"Left X months ago, but miss the format. I've already noticed how many posts there are here about books-- a good sign!"
6498,16 November 2024 at 16:47,"I left X today! Glad to see you here! 
👊💙🌊"
6499,16 November 2024 at 17:06,It’s the sort of thing I left X to get away from.
6500,16 November 2024 at 15:37,"Travis! I haven't seen you in ages. 
I left X over a rear ago.
We followed each other for years.
I hope you follow back. I always enjoyed your posts.
I was under my original handle."
6501,16 November 2024 at 18:15,"I rarely post, just introducing myself this morning.  Glad to find so many people I followed on X here on Bluesky.  I left X when Musk decided to make it his propaganda machine.  Then I found Substack, it is great for longer articles and art.  There are so many wonderful artists there."
6502,16 November 2024 at 17:21,You engaged with me first. What are you talking about? You can leave. I left X to get away from people like you. Have a great day. You won’t ruin this app for me. You’re done. Won’t be replying to you anymore ✌🏽
6503,16 November 2024 at 17:18,"People who haven’t left X yet are possibly suffering “analysis paralysis” because they can’t decide between Bluesky and Threads.  If you still have an account on X, please tell everyone to come here."
6504,16 November 2024 at 12:45,"Hello everyone, I'm new to the platform. I left X bc it became total bs and I'm so not down with giving consent to Musk to use my photos or posts so he can do whatever he wants with them..Nope..not today, tomorrow or ever."

6506,16 November 2024 at 17:33,"Thank you.  
Having left X, I hope never again to see any ad for those scammy unregulated “manhood enhancers”.  
I understand that “The Onion” now owns a warehouse of them.  
For the record, men on Bluesky don’t need them."
6507,16 November 2024 at 18:19,"I left x yesterday. But was so sad all day, missing friends, dogs, I went back. It’s really hard to lose those friendships. We do love it here though! It’s so friendly, and we’ve met lots of new friends and dogs. It’s a happy place to be! ♥️🐕💕"
6508,16 November 2024 at 18:23,Officially left X

6510,16 November 2024 at 18:40,Left X on Thursday so I am very new here. So far it’s been a breath of fresh air on this side. I’m only a couple hours in but very hopeful. I’ll take this anytime over the dread and blatant lies on X. Toxic as hell over there. Zen vibes so far!
6511,16 November 2024 at 18:40,"Wow. You are so inspirational.

How do I follow you, and revel in your brilliant wit now you have left X?

We may never recover."

  why is this account having these issues? This is one reason i left X ... there is -0- reasons for this account being marked as content warning."

6517,16 November 2024 at 18:45,I left X when this clown bought it. So glad I escaped the craziness the past few yrs.
6518,16 November 2024 at 18:17,"Well here we go! I’m new to this setup, having left X some time ago. Is it good?"
6519,21 November 2024 at 13:40,"The day after the election, over 116,000 people left X. 

Bluesky? Gained 1.2 million users in just 24 hours.

That's 10,000 new signups every 15 minutes."
6520,21 November 2024 at 13:11,I left X as soon as Elon Musk was talking about buying it
6521,21 November 2024 at 07:57,"Troublemakers who are coming on here just to cause trouble on this site because we left x should not be welcome. I dont mind differences of opinion, but to just hate on here because of our opinions is wrong..."
6522,21 November 2024 at 07:44,"The news reported 100,000 users have left X and came to Bluesky. 👏👏"
6523,21 November 2024 at 14:08,"The first jump is when Brazilians left X/Twitter en masse, after Musk refused to abide by Brazilian regulations for social media platforms. The steep climb is the US election."
6524,21 November 2024 at 14:12,Great list! Thanks! I’ve missed some of these folks since I left X over a year ago.
6525,21 November 2024 at 14:34,The KING has left X!
6526,21 November 2024 at 14:25,When I left X I had close to 900 followers I know that's not a lot but for me it was. I am now only at 31 here - can I get some follows? TIA 💙
6527,21 November 2024 at 18:37,"I had been called the n word well over 500 times on that app. By ""MAGA"" white supremacists. And as a Black woman, I have been told ""your body, my choice"" and called a slave. I left X to them and came here to escape the nonsense.

They are all bad actors. They're not welcome here."
6528,8 August 2024 at 09:23,"Thank you for the follows, let your followers know about us. If you know anyone who has left X, let them know we are on here now too 🔥"
6529,21 November 2024 at 15:08,So happy that I left X formerly Twitter. I feel as free as a songbird. Happy chirping everyone!
6530,21 November 2024 at 17:13,I left X because of all the confusion. Glad to be here. If you follow me I will follow you back. Interesting news and tidbits from Arizona.
6531,21 November 2024 at 21:11,"I’m glad I left X and coming here has been so much better:)🙂 in just about a month, I already have 400+ followers!🥺"
6532,16 November 2024 at 23:30,"I heard Sunny from the View left X!!!!! Finally.  We are winning.  I believe Trump will put them in encampments and that’s why she left.  Media keeps lying about veiwership going down, but over here,we see Truth.  Trump voter remorse in full swing."
6533,26 November 2024 at 10:21,I left X for this?
6534,26 November 2024 at 10:36,I left X when I was limited for writing ‘attempts to limit the freedom of trans people will also affect cis people’. I was by then used to being called a paedophile. Sometimes for supporting trans people but also for being in a same sex marriage.
6535,26 November 2024 at 12:08,“left X and never going back” “i’m never touching X again” i don’t give a fuck actually
6536,26 November 2024 at 11:52,Left X over a year ago. I just couldn’t.
6537,26 November 2024 at 08:04,"Wish they would, left X for good now, and need to be able to meme Norris desperately for funniest tweets ;-)"
6538,26 November 2024 at 12:57,"I really admire your approach here. I see way too many people just trying to “dunk” on any right wingers who join despite it being exactly why people left X. Sure that account might be a troll/bot, but there are TONS of real people who believe that narrative, and belligerence doesn’t help our case"
6539,26 November 2024 at 12:43,You only lost us on X because we left X.
6540,25 November 2024 at 17:46,"3. I left X after I got divorced, to respect my ex wife's space. It has become a toxic hellscape though. I never really missed it. But I missed some people. I've been fortunate to reconnect with some here"

6544,26 November 2024 at 08:46,Thanks for posting these Stephen . They were one of the many things I missed when I left x in the summer.  Keep em coming x
6545,26 November 2024 at 13:17,Hey. I have left X. Hopefully this will be a better and more productive safe space for dialogue.
6546,27 November 2024 at 12:12,I left X and deleted my account. Far nicer over here mate 😂
6547,27 November 2024 at 09:38,"Fuklberg is just as bad as Musk! Two billionaire man babies controlling the narrative to their own agenda and toxicity and exactly why I left X/Xitter/Twitter and I am beginning a gradule disengagement from FB & Meta crap! I like my social media free of Idiots agendas,Zionist,right wing Extremists"
6548,26 November 2024 at 19:37,"Exactly my sentiments. I left x in 2023 and it's nice to be here and blocking the trolls, instead of having them shoved in my face."

6551,26 November 2024 at 20:31,It’s official. I left X.
6552,26 November 2024 at 19:46,Thank you.  Definitely helps this old timer that left X and didn't save people I follow.
6553,26 November 2024 at 14:33,I left X because of all the kooks and neonazis trapping people into a dead end where you're just debating idiots who never change their mind and they get off on wasting your time. I can do without cretins negging anyone who has the slightest moral compass.
6554,26 November 2024 at 21:32,I left X due to the stupidity and mostly because of the buyer. Musk has turned that platform into a place of hate and propaganda. And Trumpers won the vote. So why are they still so mad?
6555,26 November 2024 at 20:43,emphasis on peaked - it’s all the way down now baby and hate to say it but it doesn’t look like there’s much left x
6556,26 November 2024 at 20:51,"You left X to “get away from the toxic community” so you can post that Republicans belong in concentration camps.. 

I don’t know if it’s mental illness, trolling, satire, or just the complete disregard of human life. All are equally scary."
6557,26 November 2024 at 23:08,Left X. Deactivated account and deleted app!
6558,27 November 2024 at 00:21,"So let me get this straight, I left X because I wanted to find a safe inclusive place to talk about my sports team without a toxic environment or bots. Somewhere friendly and nice?  And you feel I should leave and go back to the toxic place?  Umm, that's not inclusive is it?
P.S. no advertising here"
6559,27 November 2024 at 00:38,"I left X about 6-8 months ago and I have seen your brother talk about Bluesky a few times and finally checked it out.

I am glad I did."
6560,27 November 2024 at 02:27,"I do truly love it here!  So much less negativity!  I left X a LONG time ago due to the constant hate being spewed there.  

I’m all for open conversations with Republicans… but any hate spewing trolls are not welcome with me."
6561,27 November 2024 at 02:32,"Excellent. I keep trying to understand... But it's a cult, so we can't understand. They seem very upset we all left X."
6562,27 November 2024 at 02:35,"I just realized I haven’t posted anything since I joined. I left X a couple of years ago and really don’t miss it. I am recovering from the election outcome and ready to pay attention again. Anyway, I’m here!"
6563,27 November 2024 at 00:32,Thank you so much. I think I got everyone on this entire chain. If I missed anyone please let me know. I left X in such a hurry I left all those behind I used to follow. This is great!
6564,27 November 2024 at 00:25,"just woke up and this just angered the sleepiness out of my body. 

many of us left X because we didn’t want our data and posts feeding that shit, so to do this with our skeets is just vile

and announcing it like it’s some good news, like wtf? read room mf"
6565,27 November 2024 at 04:15,Glad to see many accounts I followed before I left X are migrating over here.
6566,27 November 2024 at 04:36,"I left X about a year ago, and I've missed you and others!!! Glad to see you here, and hope to hear you preach one day in TX."
6567,27 November 2024 at 05:23,Nefarious actors will take the content no matter what. This is why an open approach often is better. That said a lot of artist left X due to misuse.
6568,26 November 2024 at 15:48,"Mr. Free speech my 🍑. We all left X because Musk has twisted it into a MAGA echo chamber regardless of who you follow.

6571,26 November 2024 at 15:36,"You know what's nice about BlueSky? Unlike X, when you block someone, they actually can't see your posts. That's why I left X...had nothing to do with MAGA. It had to do with that because it promotes cyber stalking."

*the print is in portuguese :)"
6573,26 November 2024 at 14:38,The fuck is this bullshit politcs stuff now showing up on blusky i left X to get the fuck away from this
6574,26 November 2024 at 18:06,People announcing they've left X on LinkedIn will never not be funny. I wonder if they'll ever announce their departure from LinkedIn on Threads....
6575,22 November 2024 at 11:58,"I’m so happy for this new social media platform, I left X with no regrets, I hope to make friends and find the excitement to share and respect one another, this is a dream come true!!!
Thank you Bluesky!!!"
6576,22 November 2024 at 15:04,"Good morning all new followers. So most of you probably left X (twitter) for bluer sky's. I did too.
Why?
So sick and tired of seeing Elon Musk post every 5 seconds and/or seeing garbage HE wanted me to see.
Like as if im MAGA. Im not even American.
Happier times here with you all and my timmys eh"
6577,22 November 2024 at 13:07,"She came here to screenshot our posts. She seems focused on monetizing, so she must be pissed we left X, less money for her."
6578,22 November 2024 at 14:23,Wait! I’m the Principal here and I give out the comments. I’d say you all “need to make better friend choices” but you then again you’ve already left X. 😉
6579,22 November 2024 at 14:14,"Absolutely!! I’m having such a hard time keeping up with all the followbacks of great folks who have left X! 😂 (And it’s more important to me to connect with lots of likeminded folks, “cool” or not! ❤️"
6580,22 November 2024 at 14:10,"I left X so I could stay away from toxicity.  But the lack of critical thinking, morals, and basic intellect from the trump supporter is difficult to ignore. Every commercial, even post  mentions Trumps corruption and the lack of accountability. Need to get through 4 yrs."
6581,22 November 2024 at 14:30,I shall keep some of them on! To see them tears over us left X 😂😂😂
6582,16 November 2024 at 02:35,Left X when it was Twitter. Really hopeful that I keep my eyebrows intact here.
6583,22 November 2024 at 15:39,And I left   X  for this crap!
6584,22 November 2024 at 19:03,So someone who gets an intentional bad faith - troll- decides to block is now thin- skinned?  C’mon mate you’re kind of doing the same at this point.  People left X because it’s all trolling and bad faith arguments
6585,27 November 2024 at 16:11,"I had stopped following God when I left X and thought I was damned forever. Glad I'm not in hell, because now I see your face again."
6586,27 November 2024 at 13:34,I thought this was a kind site. I left X because of the meanness. Do we have it here too?
6587,27 November 2024 at 14:38,"Jeez, the x weirdos are coming over here now. 🙄  they're the reason I left X.  
It's probably just Muskyman in disguise."
6588,27 November 2024 at 14:48,How many have left X to date?
6589,27 November 2024 at 14:42,Asking how many of us has left X for ever?
6590,27 November 2024 at 17:15,"I left X! I did it and I find I'm in no pain - most of you seem to be here in the blue sky. So, Elon duck, ta-ta, farewell, goodbyee and good riddance."

6592,27 November 2024 at 16:32,"Left X a while back for obvious reasons. 

Left Threads about a month ago because of their weird moderation stances and an uptick in low value content getting pushed in the feed

I love Mastodon, but it’s a little too much for the average person.

So I’m basically here full time now."
6593,26 November 2024 at 16:26,Please post in full here.  Many of us have completely left X.
6594,26 November 2024 at 18:23,He's just straight up giving Kendrick more ammo to use. This is such a goofy move even for Drake. Reminds me of Elon suing advertisers because they left X.
6595,26 November 2024 at 16:59,The guy left X because his feelings were hurt and you think he's going to lead some type of revolution. FFS.
6596,27 November 2024 at 07:46,What’s wrong with Threads? It gave me somewhere to go after I left X.
6597,27 November 2024 at 14:07,Left X.
6598,27 November 2024 at 14:15,"It’s my birthday today.  
How about giving me a follow.

6749,29 November 2024 at 22:08,Question for those who have left X: Did you close your account entirely or just leave it in an archival state? I'm torn.
6750,29 November 2024 at 22:31,"Yes a very wise decision I think! So many have left X recently, I’m still posting my pictures there everyday as I don’t want to delete my account."
6751,29 November 2024 at 22:57,I left X today ! 🤩
6752,29 November 2024 at 17:39,"Most people here left X- tweeter.
It's a social platform so politics is part of it as well but here you will be free to control your engagements without being bothered with unfiltered content."

6754,29 November 2024 at 22:09,"Blocked and muted.  How horrible to receive this kind of ugliness...we left X because of this - hatred, racism, evil."
6755,30 November 2024 at 12:16,"I should add Spanish editors like El Pais,El periódico (I'm aware of) moved here and left X.

I should mention too several top EU politicians opened accounts on here too."

6757,30 November 2024 at 17:16,"No one here needs your help, we left X for a reason it was to get away from nut jobs."
6758,30 November 2024 at 16:45,"Tired of interacting with trolls that's why we left X. You don't believe we have a right to choose who we talk to, so you followed us here to force us to interact with you. Pathetic. You can't force people to talk to you. Go get a life."
6759,30 November 2024 at 16:26,Blocked both. This crap is what we left X for. Ugh! 🚫🚫🚫
6760,30 November 2024 at 17:57,"@eclipse13.bsky.social
 I’m going to follow. We all left X to get away from idiots like them. I’m going to troll until I get blocked. It’ll be fun. I’m also checking out the other 3 discovered. @MAGAFAN101, @MAGAFANBOYCANADA & @MAGAFAN69. Let’s drive them nuts."
6761,30 November 2024 at 17:29,"If that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas. 
I left X in August so I cannot retest this.

I did specify that it was fiddly and error prone.
And, it's usually one reason I avoid talking about it usually."
6762,30 November 2024 at 17:39,"www.huffpost.com/entry/ro-kha... Does he have a point ? I left X not just because I can't stand Elon, but the lies, misinformation, misogyny, racism, etc. but does it close the door to tell the truth, to push back against misogyny, Racism and lies?"
6763,30 November 2024 at 17:47,I left X a couple of weeks after you-know-who bought it. Haven't missed it a bit!
6764,30 November 2024 at 17:54,"If every anti-Trumper left X, the platform would collapse.  This is how we break up the disinformation environment."
6765,24 November 2024 at 02:20,Missed hearing from you when I left X years ago. Glad to see you on the other side.

6767,24 November 2024 at 02:26,"I left X yesterday, it's literally just a bunch of maggots"
6768,24 November 2024 at 04:38,"IHMO—MAGA are addicted to the chaos that Trump produces non-stop, & they’re missing the folks who left X. They’re not enjoying themselves if they can’t spread hate, & they’re desperate to find folks to hate on. Theres an uptick of hateful MAGA invading public Dem conversations on FB.Block & ignore."
6769,24 November 2024 at 03:11,Nobody here likes or wants to talk to you. Are you just stupid? Clearly you idiots don’t take a hint. We left X BECAUSE WE DONT WANT TO TALK TO YALL! So go talk to other cult members in your echo chamber.
6770,24 November 2024 at 03:29,"I left x the day after election...I'm ready for a new, calmer home 🤗"
6771,24 November 2024 at 03:51,"Funny how after your desperate plea for attention as you left x, u claimed you were never returning.... 

Odd you would still be stalking people on there"
6772,14 November 2024 at 22:30,Why I left X: it became those guys who graduated but came back to the high school parking lot to sell weed or otherwise prey on someone.
6773,24 November 2024 at 00:11,Why I left X: it became those guys who graduated but came back to the high school parking lot to sell weed or otherwise prey on someone.

6776,24 November 2024 at 07:28,"I left X early this year. It’s now a much better world, without Elon’s tweets."
6777,24 November 2024 at 04:53,"Left X, not in order to find my “safe space”,but wanting to drown out the crowd. That insists on only feeding off of hate, lies and conspiracy rabbit holes. I would rather have conversations with the actual adults in the “room”."
6778,24 November 2024 at 08:01,I agree. Please don’t bring that guy over here. 😂😂😂 he’s one of the reasons I left X. One of the MANY.
6779,24 November 2024 at 20:04,"Wow you actually left X!!
Still haven’t pulled the trigger…🤷🏼‍♂️"
6780,24 November 2024 at 19:17,Remember when you all left X bc your fragile egg shell psyche could not handle the fact that a very very large portion of your fellow man rejected your entire belief system?
6781,27 November 2024 at 21:04,"Left: X is full of bots and misinformation
MAGA: No, it's full of Patriots!
China: Hey, we paid good money for the bots to spread misinformation to get our guy elected. Why is everyone leaving?"

6783,28 November 2024 at 03:22,"Ever notice how much attention ends up in the same place "" leftist"" go. 

""Leftist"" must be a buzzword for interesting people. 

Right wing nuts whinning because we left X after Musk's pushed misinformation on us. 

Other platforms throttled down political discussion, so we collect here."
6784,28 November 2024 at 03:14,"Following 
Just left X"
6785,28 November 2024 at 01:15,"Hey Mayor Wu, seeing as you left X. I figured I’d ask here. Can you please explain this?"

6787,24 November 2024 at 12:59,Left X. Left China. Left my sunglasses in Vietnam.
6788,24 November 2024 at 12:07,"An early morning musing. I welcome all opinions. I left X, and I'm at peace with that decision. I'm quite unsettled though in deleting my account. I don't want him counting my ""dead"" account in his numbers for his enrichment. However, I want my thoughts to remain as a permanent record. Thoughts?"
6789,24 November 2024 at 12:05,How long will that last when his engagement falls bc people left X?
6790,24 November 2024 at 12:21,"I learned that Elon supports the Carrot Man and left. X was also full of drama, and people didn't interact with your posts unless you had a famous account. It was so fake on there."
6791,24 November 2024 at 09:46,"Nice to meet you all! 
I'm formerly @MyDutyCyOps on 
#Twitter
. I left X, which had no control over bots and misinformation, and from today I will be broadcasting here at 
#Bluesky
. Thank you."
6792,24 November 2024 at 14:09,"The reason I left X is that when I argue with someone here, we both believe Truth is objective."
6793,24 November 2024 at 14:14,The fact that you left X and are whining here shows you truly lost
6794,25 November 2024 at 02:02,I know....FB suppressed me so bad...in 8 months there since I left X...I have no friends or followers. 😂Meanwhile...got 198 here in than 2 weeks.  It's a mind bogglingly Orwellian idiot's site.  They have removed quotes by both Isaac Bashevis Singer and Huxley..calling them 'dangerous individuals'.
6795,23 November 2024 at 21:24,"I want to say I've left x/twitter fully behind, but they're currently making cups of tea in their air fryers over there and Bluesky just aint there yet"
6796,23 November 2024 at 22:03,I left X this week and was so excited to find you here!! Go Illini!!
6797,23 November 2024 at 22:38,"Hello, just seen that you have left X, so thought I'd follow you here Martijn."
6798,23 November 2024 at 20:38,People who have just left X are akin to those who finally flee a domestic violence relationship. I surmise there was constant trolling and abuse. After awhile it becomes normal. It’s sad and awful. Please let’s not normalize this troupe of vagabonds. Let’s expel them.
6799,23 November 2024 at 19:58,"Lovely, Helen! I’ve missed seeing your posts since I left X a year ago. So glad to find you here."
6800,23 November 2024 at 22:52,Anyone left x
6801,23 November 2024 at 21:02,Hey! Glad to see you left X too! Great to see you here!
6802,23 November 2024 at 21:15,Before I left X I deleted all my tweets and unfollowed all accounts. My feed seemed to improve. I think Musk tweaked the algorithm to show confrontational trash to people that followed mostly progressive accounts. And then I deactivated my account.
6803,23 November 2024 at 18:50,"I like having you ,people can fully see your ignorance, and why 19 million left X in two days.Delete Weapon X-Mars is a terraforming scam."

6805,22 November 2024 at 23:02,Here ! Left X because it has become an ecjo box.
6806,2 December 2024 at 20:20,"I am actually very happy to be here on Blue Sky.  I totally left X and am very happy I cut ties altogether. It feels really good.  I know no space is  going to be perfect, it's our own mindset in how we choose to see things. I choose to support H&M and others, and know when it's time to mute/block."
6807,1 December 2024 at 21:15,"Glad you left X, but please don’t think a hashtag, follows, and RT’s is }activism, it’s vanity. We already learned this won’t save a democracy the past 15 years.

6808,1 December 2024 at 21:16,I left X because it’s bad for mental health.
6809,1 December 2024 at 21:22,"Nice one. Let's stop the corruption that we left X to avoid. Let's keep the nice vibe here. 
#FBPE"
6810,1 December 2024 at 21:10,I left x 3 days ago Quietly No announcement.
6811,1 December 2024 at 17:59,I left X because Elon boosted the dumbest posters among us and killed the value of Twitter.
6812,1 December 2024 at 17:50,"I left X because it was shitty.
There was no meaningful conversation anymore and an onslaught of bots, and toxic morons."
6813,1 December 2024 at 19:41,Can't we have all left X because we're not into racism and porn?
6814,1 December 2024 at 19:58,I left ‘X’ because it continued to ‘ElonGate’ the truth 😳
6815,1 December 2024 at 16:03,"Nah. Many of us left X because we don’t care to engage with people who use racist, sexist, homophobic, misogynist language, who spread false information, and who call Dems “commies.” WHY are they insisting that we engage with them? It’s a very entitled attitude they have."
6816,1 December 2024 at 21:25,"Nobody left X simply because they ""didn't like Elon"". That's horseshit.

The people that embrace that cesspool and embrace toxic, corrosive confrontation is why people left. 

And why a lot of them are now coming here. Even the people who thrive off of dumping that poison can't breathe it."
6817,1 December 2024 at 15:13,"So glad you’ve come over here. I left X about a year ago for my personal posts and a couple of weeks ago for my

6819,2 December 2024 at 05:01,The non-Black user being too leftist is some real sh*t. But everytime I open X I remember why I left X.
6820,2 December 2024 at 02:56,We left X when it stopped being Twitter because we’re a band and we don’t like to play to fascists.  Not our crowd.
6821,2 December 2024 at 01:47,"I left ""x"" because it was vile."
6822,2 December 2024 at 03:15,😂😂 I left X two weeks ago. Deactivated my account. This was it 👇🏻👇🏻
6823,2 December 2024 at 06:26,"Well, I left X looking for some civility , sadly, here we go again.😔"
6824,2 December 2024 at 12:03,"So glad I left X when I did! Seeing all the bullshit coming from there since the election, makes me happy seeing nothing but book reviews and drag on here lol"
6825,2 December 2024 at 12:25,"To my friends who have left X , welcome. I will be contacting all on Facebook, to let you know, I will eventually make the switch here permanently."
6826,2 December 2024 at 11:19,"I'm not a Democrat and left X as soon as Musk bought it. It needs to be dismantled. It's a cesspool of racism, bigotry and stupidity."
6827,2 December 2024 at 13:55,“hyper partisan and unfunny liberals who have gone retarded flock”! Is this the  “ unfriendly skies” you speak of? What about less hateful speech to make your point? Most of us left X to get away from childish name calling. Bluesky is supposed a space to find more mature responses from BOTH sides!
6828,2 December 2024 at 13:45,"We voted with our feet when we left 
#x
.

Lo and behold some people who were deeply invested in keeping us mad and miserable were upset by that."
6829,2 December 2024 at 15:00,That’s one of the reasons we left X so how is it making Bluesky good? Were trying to avoid this turning into twitter
6830,2 December 2024 at 09:43,LOL. Jon Sopel ('journalist') 'left' X and came back within 2 days.
6831,24 November 2024 at 00:20,And I left X for this shot show?
6832,24 November 2024 at 00:23,Thank you for introducing me to Bluesky! Joined today! I had no idea that this existed.  What a coincidence that I left X yesterday! Eff that guy!
6833,24 November 2024 at 00:26,Left X and now I see nothing but Blue Skies. Hello everyone 👋🏾
6834,24 November 2024 at 00:51,"I left X yesterday after I told 2A absolutists to shut the hell up, put down the funny shape dice, and go to Hooter’s already. Well, anyway, total meltdown. It was interesting to see as they tried to intimidate me. X is trash."
6835,24 November 2024 at 01:25,"I left x a year ago when my reports of racism and anti semitism 'didn't breach standards' and I thought what's the point. It was very overtly right wing then, and it wasn't the left fleeing, it was decency leaving in disgust."
6836,24 November 2024 at 00:39,"Meanwhile everyone on here is talking about Trump and his voters constantly. You left X to get away from them yet they seem to live rent free in your head. Before you come at me for being MAGA, I'm centrist and Canadian so I don't support or care about Trump."
6837,24 November 2024 at 00:47,Many of us “left” X last year while y’all stayed. Yeah I have my account and the only thing I posted in a year was my wordle performance.
6838,24 November 2024 at 00:38,"Isn't it so much better!! 🦋
I haven't been called the C word since I left X! 

I guess I officially have an ex-X !"

6841,23 November 2024 at 05:05,Hank I left X because of the anxiety this is too much.
6842,23 November 2024 at 04:57,"I do love all the climate scientists here having reserched AGW/CC and our top solutions for around 25 years now.

Was smaller on X yet there are some amazing people who were there and the ReFi (Regenerative Finance) network is strong there.  

I know many people have left X after the massive changes"

6850,1 December 2024 at 19:30,I left X because I don't like X under Elon Musk.
6851,1 December 2024 at 19:48,"I left X because I didn’t enjoy being there, but I’m sure Musk contributed to that. 
I reckon I’m not the only one who leave a place when it’s not enjoyable"
6852,1 December 2024 at 20:00,This kind of post is why I left X
6853,1 December 2024 at 20:27,Go to X and tap “For You”. Look at “your” feed. That’s why I left X.
6854,1 December 2024 at 20:55,I left X last fall for reasons big and small. I will not be generalized for doing so.
6855,1 December 2024 at 20:29,"New to Bluesky, I left X(twitter) platform due having major personal issues with content and Elon Musk. This will be my first post, happy to be here!"
6856,1 December 2024 at 20:36,No. We left X because it became an entirely different place. Nobody keeps going back to a mall after all the good stores left and it starts dying. Same deal with that social media site. It’s bitcoin junk now.
6857,1 December 2024 at 20:20,"Not this blue witch! I left X ASAP!  (Twitter is long gone, if you haven't heard.) True followers follow, all you have to say is ""Follow me elsewhere.""  Boom, done!"
6858,1 December 2024 at 18:05,"I fly below the radar so people don’t really engage with me that often but I left X because 1/2 the people who liked my posts or followed me were either scammers or bots, the ads were childish and they kept ramming into my feed right wing postings and blocking it all never worked anyway."

6861,1 December 2024 at 18:27,Left X for good. Hit me up sometime.
6862,1 December 2024 at 18:02,Oooh that pic was me patomining 😂 I'm using it just until I decide which one I actually want to use. Also it was the energy with which I left X at the time so it felt apropos.

Hi, Molly, good to find you here on BlueSky. 😉
We were mutuals on X and I left X for good. 👍"

6881,1 December 2024 at 00:21,I left X in part to escape  the constant Trump talk. This place is no better. Help me find others to follow that don't constantly  talk about that ass. Thanks.

7294,13 November 2024 at 17:14,So checked out from everything (and left X) that I missed that Tony Todd died. What an amazing actor and person.
7295,13 November 2024 at 14:59,"@addiem.bsky.social
 my Swifties have left X and are moving here so I joined!"
7296,13 November 2024 at 15:00,How long until all the people we left X for find their way here?
7297,13 November 2024 at 12:35,"I left X a while ago, for obvious reasons. I’m here to start fresh and get away from the BS on FB."
7298,13 November 2024 at 12:35,I’ve left x but not deactivated - I probably should
7299,13 November 2024 at 15:34,"I left X, does that make me a survivor or everyone else,"
7300,13 November 2024 at 17:24,Hard same and BTW so glad to follow you here since we left X.
7301,13 November 2024 at 17:34,"I left X for two main reasons, AI and the litigation jeopardy of the headquarters move.

These contributed to a sense of “this is not a safe place to be,” beyond the general harassment by bots and trolls."
7302,13 November 2024 at 16:02,"@mrjamesob.bsky.social
 Thanks for the tip about bsky.app as I left X months ago and used to follow you."
7303,13 November 2024 at 17:35,I left X the minute Musk bought it.
7304,13 November 2024 at 17:31,Left X after being on twitter since 2009…. Happy to be here and following slowly everyone I was following before.
7305,13 November 2024 at 17:44,I left X months ago... Welcome!
7306,13 November 2024 at 16:24,"That’s your opinion, which is  fine … actually one left X to get away from rudeness, but here you are."
7307,13 November 2024 at 13:26,"Hi there Bluesky! I left X for good, since it only displayed garlean propaganda on my tomestone.

I'm Darce Ciel. Part time photographer, bartender and chef. You can find me chatting around Ul'dah. Nice to meet ya!"
7308,13 November 2024 at 16:05,I’m so happy you left X.
7309,13 November 2024 at 18:19,"Yes, one of the reasons I left X was because of all the bots, porn and sex toy ads. As long as this site keeps the garbage out, it’d be worth it."
7310,13 November 2024 at 18:41,"Glad to find you here my friend. Left X, AmazonPrime, and Amazon. My first efforts at fighting back."
7311,13 November 2024 at 17:59,"Left X over a year ago. Went to threads, Post News. Much better here"
7312,13 November 2024 at 18:21,"algorithm was too heavily set to favor any post that ripped on Elon or X. So every post was: I just left X because Elon is a POS. Which, while true, is not a sustainable business model. Between that, the lack of a chronological timeline and the throttling of news/politics, the app never had a chance"
7313,13 November 2024 at 18:48,"Good to see you here!
Left X & just joined BlueSky. Feels good🦋"
7314,13 November 2024 at 19:29,"New here today. Left x when it was bought by a very bad man. 
Will be trying to connect with old friends and make some new friends. 
❤️"

7323,13 November 2024 at 20:20,The Guardian has left X but I’m not sure it’s related to ToS.
7324,15 November 2024 at 14:43,"But you do, and you make it clear by alerting everyone you're here to post MAGA and ven encourage other MAGA to come here. You're only here to ruin things.

I left X because of the porn, gore, AI, and legit nazis. Why are you here?"
7325,15 November 2024 at 13:39,Thank you to all my Pittsburgh Pirates fans family who I'm finding here and are following me back! I was afraid I would lose that when I left X but here we all are!
7326,15 November 2024 at 13:49,I’ve left X… looking for my followers her on Bluesky
7327,15 November 2024 at 13:59,So are we “Blueskees” or “Skyvers” or what??  Left X at least a year ago.  Thought I’d give this a go. Hello from Manitoba!

7330,15 November 2024 at 12:22,FUNNY MESSAGE FOR ALL THOSE WHO LEFT X TO JOIN BLUESKY!
7331,15 November 2024 at 14:45,"I left X last night. Twitter and her beautiful inhabitants will forever remain fondly in my heart. I completely understand anyone who chooses to stay, but for me, it was a necessary mental health choice. To each their own!"

7333,15 November 2024 at 05:56,"I finally left ""X"" today. Now I can breathe a sigh of relief. The air is clearer over here. 🦋 🌼"

7341,15 November 2024 at 17:06,Poop. I left X and she was the one person I don’t think I had contact info for elsewhere
7342,15 November 2024 at 17:50,"You don't know me, but I watched you on MSNBC. And was outraged when you were fired. I left X because it is a cesspool of hate, racism, misinformation, disinformation, fascism, etc."
7343,15 November 2024 at 21:00,I know this was hard but as someone who left X I am looking forward to all your continuing stories! I really enjoy them.

7348,15 November 2024 at 21:42,Yeah! Finally cut the cord and left X. It feels liberating. Glad to be on BlueSky.
7349,15 November 2024 at 21:30,I left X minutes after they called the election for the future guy. After witnessing the attacks that seemed had been planned against large account Kamala supporters. But when they attacked Luke Skywalker. I said these people are barbaric I’m out of here. The force was with you👍
7350,15 November 2024 at 21:53,I'm loving this. My first day here. My 17 year old came in and said mom leave x and go to bluesky like me. Minutes later she helped find this bluesky and I left x. I sooooooo love this space already. ❤️❤️❤️
7351,15 November 2024 at 22:00,I think lots of people left X
7352,14 November 2024 at 23:56,"My 1st post to 
#Bluesky

7353,15 November 2024 at 00:42,I just left X too. That guy and his powerful friend worry me. Hello Bluesky!
7354,15 November 2024 at 01:29,"Left X a long time ago, there's hardly anyone on MeWe, so here I am!"
7355,15 November 2024 at 01:30,Left X. Goodbye Elon!
7356,15 November 2024 at 01:01,I left X as soon as Elon bought it. I think it wasn’t even called X then.
7357,14 November 2024 at 23:31,"Left X today to join Bluesky! 
#newbeginnings
 #jointhemovement"
7358,15 November 2024 at 00:00,I just left X for good and will be exclusively on here
7359,14 November 2024 at 20:11,What a relief to have left X behind!
7360,14 November 2024 at 19:37,I left X/Twitter and an E*lon super fan who RTs Barstool and comments on thirst trap pictures of women followed me here to say “no one cares” - he is derailing and melting down
7361,14 November 2024 at 20:23,All this high tech and they can't handle the massive surge incoming from X...😂😂 I can't believe how many people have left X. Serves Elon right for being a prick! 😂
7362,14 November 2024 at 21:03,That is why I left X
7363,14 November 2024 at 15:48,Just left X…going to give BlueSky a shot…let’s get it.
7364,14 November 2024 at 16:50,I did it!   I left X and deleted the app!!  It is BlueSky now all the way!
7365,14 November 2024 at 17:14,Finally made it here and left X 👋
7366,14 November 2024 at 18:18,I left X in search of a clearer sky🌌
7367,14 November 2024 at 18:12,Twitter used to be a leftist cesspool. Twitter used to be a propaganda machine for the government to censor americans. Twitter used to be a glorified echo chamber doing the bidding of the marxist left. X is the news now!
7368,14 November 2024 at 18:44,I literally just left X to come here cause it was a trump and Elon ad first post.
7369,14 November 2024 at 18:40,"Hi, I am a nude photographer. I just left X and got on bluesky and was looking people with the same interest as me and found you."
7370,14 November 2024 at 19:21,Hey all. Left X for a kinder social.
7371,14 November 2024 at 19:04,"Like so many here, I left X which I hated anyway. I hated it because every time there was even a minor report on seemingly anything, 50+ people would repost it! Please don't let Bluesky turn into that garbage redundancy. Can we not assume if people are news hounds, they will have already found it?"
7372,14 November 2024 at 22:05,First post! Left X awhile ago. Found Threads but it’s a swamp of OF fem bots. Hopefully this is way better!
7373,14 November 2024 at 22:03,"I left ‘X’ to see if this is a place to solve the problem of the festering sore on our American Institution. We need to “Stop the Steal (by the GOP)” as in, stop them from stealing money from SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, Education, etc. Stay Strong, Stay LOUD!"
7374,15 November 2024 at 00:15,"Well, I’ve left X (Twitter). I’m hopeful that this new experiment works out."
7375,14 November 2024 at 22:39,And I receive these suggestive pictures from women who do not seem to post. I thought that I was rid of this when I left X. Thanks!
7376,14 November 2024 at 22:32,Thank you! I’m finding accounts here that left X quite some time ago and glad I joined!
7377,14 November 2024 at 23:00,I am so 💙HAPPY💙 to leave 💩X💩 and start a BlueSky account! Like this if you left X too.
7378,14 November 2024 at 23:39,"It’s an X(twitter) alternative. Approx 1 million never trumpers left X the day after the election and came over to this alternate site.  Hopefully, Musk can keep orange and his nut over there"
7379,15 November 2024 at 11:45,Finally left X and joined bluesky! So far so good. Looking forward to reconnecting with the good folks who I met on the dark side!!
7380,15 November 2024 at 11:04,So left X becuse it’s a cesspit. Joined bluesky and it’s already full of onlyfans wannabes and those who ruined x with there porn and nonsensical political views. God social media is rotten.
7381,15 November 2024 at 11:21,Finally left X. Now I gotta find my crew on here.
7382,15 November 2024 at 09:47,I left X to escape his hateful nonsense
7383,15 November 2024 at 13:18,"I'm one that previously checked it out and left.

This time around I've left X for good and I'm staying with Bluesky. Time to make some connections..."
7384,15 November 2024 at 15:23,Just because we are on Bluesky doesn't mean we left X lol
7385,15 November 2024 at 15:49,Left X recently. Here for an introvert community
7386,15 November 2024 at 16:05,"Not recognizing your anger directly. But good day to you. Tip though. Every human that left X and moved here, has been readily identified already. FYI"
7387,15 November 2024 at 16:01,Finally left X. Let me introduce my kitty Layla and my shadow Fifi. 😊
7388,15 November 2024 at 14:01,So refreshing to be back on social media. Left X since musk got it

7397,15 November 2024 at 16:18,I hope so also. I just left x too much hate for my hippie soul.
7398,15 November 2024 at 16:26,I just left X! The hate was getting to be too much!
7399,15 November 2024 at 16:41,This platform is so refreshing. I left X after Musk was appointed into the MAGA cult and is now trying to take over democracy.
7400,15 November 2024 at 16:28,I'm here to see what I can see. Left X-Twitter a year ago. Looking to learn more and be better
7401,15 November 2024 at 15:40,"Just joined. Left X a few weeks ago. Also on Threads but this is worth a try. Left of left of Centre politically, gay man who identifies with LGB folk, avid reader, married with 3 wonderful cats"
7402,7 November 2024 at 13:00,Really happy that you're here.. left X yesterday for the same reason.
7403,7 November 2024 at 10:26,Hopefully even more in the last 2 days!!  I've left X forever
7404,7 November 2024 at 10:16,Nice to see you here Sarah!  I left X yesterday.
7405,7 November 2024 at 12:50,Welp I left X and now there’s only here.
7406,7 November 2024 at 08:46,Hi! I left X. Am new here and just wanted to say hi.
7407,8 November 2024 at 19:19,Part of the reason I left 'X' was the amount of Temu ads popping up. Even though I 'clicked' not to see this ad again. If I see another here. I'm off.
7408,8 November 2024 at 16:41,"Left X 
Looking for the boys"
7409,8 November 2024 at 19:41,"Pleased to have left x hello Blue Sky 
Home is the Solway froth on the Scottish Borders - I’m so lucky !"
7410,8 November 2024 at 13:49,Joined up just a few minutes ago; liking it already! Reminds me of the early days of Twitter (I recently left X)
7411,8 November 2024 at 20:22,"Thanks, Kresten!
Just left X. Good to be out of that increasingly weird place.

Seeing this analysis here about Musk's propaganda machine gave me the rest :-)  www.lemonde.fr/internationa... (only visible when subscribed to Le Monde; good journalism cannot be free...)."
7412,8 November 2024 at 14:25,I'm sorry to hear that and i hope things get better now that you left X.
7413,8 November 2024 at 14:56,I have successfully left X (in the correct order of data erasure)…. And deleted that app for all my personal and business purposes. I had basically left it dormant in the past year anyway…..
7414,8 November 2024 at 20:47,"I just left X for Bluesky, I'm really glad to see you active here :)"
7415,9 November 2024 at 23:41,Hurray!!! I left X on Wednesday and I notice a lot of people joining in those few days. So glad you’re here. We need you leadership.

7418,9 November 2024 at 07:59,"Like many others, I have left  X/Twitter, hopefully for good. This is my first post here. I already find Bluesky to be so much more peaceful and welcoming. I am hoping all the great people I used to follow are regulars here soon, some already are!"

7425,16 November 2024 at 00:17,"Just left X, we up 😻🙌"
7426,16 November 2024 at 01:43,One of the reasons I left X was because the last 12 accounts that followed me were all sexy lady bots.
7427,16 November 2024 at 00:44,"The hard part is finding where everyone is over here, after years of building a group I liked to listen to on twitter.
I left X months ago for my sanity.
I have been here a few days & it's just like the first exciting fun filled years of twitter.
Lovely and engaging.
See you at break time..."

7430,16 November 2024 at 01:02,"Spain's La Vanguardia left X citing ""toxic content,"" and Britain's Guardian also quit the platform on Tuesday over racism and conspiracy theories.

7433,15 November 2024 at 23:46,"Yes, there is. It’s a big reason why I left X. You’ve seen how vicious I can be. And that’s not who I want to be for the rest of my life.

I’ll certainly get as vicious as I have to be if I’m defending myself. I don’t care what I have to do in that case. But past that? It’s a toxic lifestyle choice."
7434,16 November 2024 at 02:07,"Found you brother on BlueSky after you left ""X"", thank you again for your honesty,  loyalty to the truth & transparency.  It's helped me so much. Lemonheads 🍋 ✌🏾"
7435,15 November 2024 at 17:55,"I know why everyone left X and while it was funny it seems now all it does is make my blood pressure go up. I’m gonna have to close my tik tok account before I stroke out!!! Nothing but so called Christians preaching hate and Trumpers that don’t believe facts!
How do you defeat miss information?"

Left X(sh)itter and not missing the negativity and BS at all."
7611,14 November 2024 at 15:09,"Some say that people who left X and came to Bluesky want to live in a bubble. I reject that notion. Instead, I’d suggest that people moved because they wish to debate differing ideas openly, free from algorithms designed to frustrate discussion and amplify mis- and disinformation to serve an agenda."
7612,14 November 2024 at 14:54,"Oregon here, left x and fb sometime back."
7613,14 November 2024 at 14:33,"I’m obviously a paragon of exquisite virtue but I left X when a man bought it and said “Hi, I’m a white supremacist and have purchased this website to tip the scales in favour of the white supremacists on it.”

I’m as shocked as anyone it’s gone to shit but unless you’re planning on buying it back—?"

7617,16 November 2024 at 12:44,"OK, let's move beyond the question of why people left X and think about the emergent nature of Bluesky. Are/will there be many conservative voices on here? I'm quite sceptical about the value of a political social network with little ideological diversity!"
7618,16 November 2024 at 12:41,"This week, tons of artists left X, and most moved here. The reason is X's new policy that states all the content artists publish on the platform will be used to train an AI system, and they (the artists) will not be able to legally claim rights (Check Loish's numbers, it's insane)."
7619,16 November 2024 at 15:02,"Just left X and downloaded this app, good to hear"
7620,16 November 2024 at 14:19,"Finally done it, I’ve left X, closed my account and given it the round of f@&ks it deserves. It had become more toxic than a room full of western taipans. Looking forward to some interesting dialogue now without the narrow minded interjections from brain dead individuals."
7621,16 November 2024 at 14:45,"I left X this week so I’m not impressed by a few people here bringing screen shots of stuff there. No matter how powerful the point being made, I’m not really interested in reading that vitriol here. My policy is a simple one and that’s to block those accounts that transgress no matter who. 👋"
7622,16 November 2024 at 14:55,"I might as well introduce myself now that so many people are here:

Hii, I’m FK. I love food, fashion, and politics. 

I’m a philosophy major and I’m also a tropical fruit farmer! 

I left X because it’s absolute trash, hope to connect with a lot of you here on Bluesky! 🦋"

7627,16 November 2024 at 12:27,I left X when Musk bought it so I’m glad to be able to follow you again.
7628,16 November 2024 at 12:28,"I left x with a couple of months of the Musk purchase. It quickly became obvious he cared nothing about a ""fair "" platform, free speech or hate speech and he quickly started with right wing propaganda. Been waiting for a new site."

7632,16 November 2024 at 13:15,"Ah, it’s good to reconnect as a follower, Dan. Having left x-itter early doors, I missed your scholarly insights. It feels like this place may be indeed a pastoral landscape of erudite commentary and eloquent banter. Here’s hoping it remains this way!"
7633,16 November 2024 at 13:14,"at this stage of life’s journey I question all social media & its relevance to me. 

Left X + LinkedIN.

Use Facebook mostly for family & overseas friends. 

Use & like Insta - a picture paints 1000 words and all that. 

Here, I’m still uncertain, though it’s refreshing  post the toxicity of X."
7634,16 November 2024 at 16:23,I just left X a few days ago also.  Glad to see you here too
7635,16 November 2024 at 16:44,"I wonder if Musk or Trump tries to have a profile on this platform, will blue sky delete and block them? I hope so. We don't need their maga proporganda here. That is why we left X/Twitter."

7639,16 November 2024 at 17:26,"One of the reason people left X is these kind of posts using abusive language, we were raised better to disagree with others using persuasive language- however behind screens people like Noorani sahib is done is no better than what we expect to behave in public"
7640,16 November 2024 at 18:09,I like this because we didn’t leave twitter. We left x. Twitter died.
7641,16 November 2024 at 16:49,"This is 😂You come to a thread where people are talking about something they care deeply about, you poke at people until they respond, and then “gosh y’all are a bunch of meanies!  See, I was right! Dems only insult and rant!” When you know we left X because MAGAs were literally threatening to 🍇 us."
7642,16 November 2024 at 18:11,So happy I left X. It has truly become a place where grifters and losers thrive by spreading nonsense
7643,16 November 2024 at 17:28,"They saw people leaving X in droves, so to continue accessing an audience with which to forment the hate and anger they need, they follow where the masses they need are going.

This despite the fact we all left X because of people like her and her ilk."

7663,16 November 2024 at 17:45,Left X.. done!
7664,18 November 2024 at 17:36,"I posted this graphic on my X account when I stopped posting on it in September. I wanted to keep my account (for the reasons given in the article), but also make clear why I wasn't using it.

7670,16 November 2024 at 04:04,Seeing a lot of this in the past week or so. Especially from artists who’d left X “early” and folks that haven’t seen their works in some time seemingly feeling entitled to their time.
7671,16 November 2024 at 20:17,I left X Tuesday night.  Election Day.  I was sick of that hate speech platform.

We left X for so many reasons but the trolls and smooth brained users can follow

Block them.
Don’t Engage. 
Let them shout into the void like the do in real life because no one likes them 🫡

7760,19 November 2024 at 20:25,Some of us don't know the struggle of being divide between using Bluesky and using Twitter (X) because we left X way before Bluesky came about.
7761,19 November 2024 at 20:41,"@wrongsreversed.bsky.social
 had the details on a guy on X who set up false accounts for any writer in the news. He set one up in the name of Han Kang when she won the Nobel, and I'm pretty sure an account in the name of Samantha Harvey, which I saw just before I left X, was him again."
7762,19 November 2024 at 22:43,It’s funny how left leaning blue sky is and now everyone’s left x how right wing that’s become… someone should study this
7763,19 November 2024 at 22:41,"Agree. Its reason #658 I left “X”. 

It’s not in my nature to ignore sexist, racist, bigoted shitbag comments from shitbags — but not doing so just adds to toxicity … it never defeats it. 

Here - is a clean slate. 

I’ll follow suit…"

7768,20 November 2024 at 17:51,Also the metanarrative that your username lost the _x when you left X is very on the nose.
7769,20 November 2024 at 17:52,Is that what you left X to do?
7770,20 November 2024 at 00:34,Thanks left X for good today

If you don’t see  the difference, you ARE dumb enough to vote for Trump. I tried with you, but you didn’t come here in good faith. You came to troll us. We left X to get away from MAGAts."
7772,15 November 2024 at 23:17,Good evening from Godley Texas. Left X and found Blue sky. If we followed each other on X please follow back.
7773,15 November 2024 at 23:46,I just left X formerly Twitter after many years. Couldn’t take the crap anymore and @elonmusk in particular.

7777,14 November 2024 at 14:52,"I know I should have left X a year ago.  I had people there I loved talking to, and I'm lazy I guess.  I really won't miss the engagement farming ""X has shadow banned me, like if you can see this""?  posts, that's for sure."
7778,14 November 2024 at 17:16,"Need this positive energy on here, which is why I left X Social. At this point, I don't have the patience to deal with these f*cks anymore so please don't bother following if you are a magat."
7779,14 November 2024 at 00:30,I was getting pretty fed-up with some of the things I was seeing there & this feels like Twitter from ye olden days when people 'chatted' and the hate wasn't as rampant as it is now. It feels good to be reconnecting with those who left X & to make new connections with folks like you!

7783,20 November 2024 at 17:58,"A little late for them to do that. And now I'm seeing people making fun of those who left X calling them crybabies and leftist, Some even saying Bsky isn't great and overly positive."
7784,20 November 2024 at 23:45,"So most of the artists, musicians poets, sculptors, philosophers, actors and other people that care about their children and grandchildren's future on this planet have left

 leaving X a big dark pile of s*** with no culture just as it should be."
7785,21 November 2024 at 16:46,"That's what most of us on BlueSky believes. We all left X because it had become so toxic you couldn't debate or disagree there without it digressing into worthless anger and toxic abuse, let alone work on solutions. I hope the new accounts joining adopt this philosophy as well."
7786,21 November 2024 at 15:11,"Completely agree. It’s not to provide context for their positions, it’s just to create strife. We all left X and now they’re lonely and have no one to dunk on."
7787,21 November 2024 at 16:13,You would be right if MAGA members weren’t so toxic. You counter their arguments with facts. The MAGA reflex is to insult you and call you every dirty name in the book. Millions of us left X because of that.
7788,21 November 2024 at 16:44,We left X bc of them. They are toxic.
7789,21 November 2024 at 19:33,"Oh Hello there:🦋’s

7828,22 November 2024 at 11:36,So you've left X to come shill for paedophiles? Sure they need treatment and help but you cannot try sell this as something needing mass sympathy.bthose children who have been damaged might not agree.

7830,22 November 2024 at 14:21,"That's the reason I left X. Sick of all of the arguments and stupidity. If you can find some moderate Republicans to add, go for it. Do not add Mega because they cannot be reasoned with."

I agree
BUT
Twitter isn't the vehicle for it you're literally wasting your time at this point
when you could be spending your time building up community here."
7840,22 November 2024 at 14:30,"We left X because it turned into a cesspool of trolls and bad faith actors posting outrage bait to generate engagement. That doesn't ""broaden our horizons""- it makes us angry and more entrenched on our ""side"". 

Also we don't just use social media to yell at each other about politics all the time."

No she didn't.  
This is why liberals left X, so they can spread lies."

7872,17 November 2024 at 20:42,The fact that so many people left X for Bluesky and not Threads is probably a clear indicator that Threads is never going to be anything on the social media landscape.

Since I left X, I lost a lot of people I followed for trustworthy news / insights on the Ukraine war (and downfall of Russia).
Do you have a BlueSky starter pack of recommended people to follow here (preferably in English)?"
7896,23 November 2024 at 12:23,Bruh this app proves that when they say leave if you don't like it that they don't mean it. We left X and they couldnt even handle that. They have a need to be the center of it allIf everyone non white person left America and went back to their country of origin this would be one boring ass country.
7897,23 November 2024 at 12:26,"No, you imbecile. What it means is, 1 million pussies left X for *anything* other than X, and the rest of the numbers are just curious what bluesky (too stupid to separate the two words?) was like and to watch and see what pansy idiots are actually staying on it."
7898,23 November 2024 at 20:40,I don't see leftists threatening people and their families with concentration camps and death. That's a Maga thing. That's why most of us left X. Leaving X seems to have triggered them and they feel they have the right to use us as punching bags.

7900,23 November 2024 at 18:14,I gladly left x but I do miss the animal videos that gave me so much joy and many laughs. Are there any here that I can follow?  My favorite was the man (RxCKSTxR) who does hysterical voiceovers of pets.
7901,23 November 2024 at 18:31,So y’all left X to bring politics here? That’s crazy
7902,24 November 2024 at 03:18,"Nah, it's always the left trying to take over & censor & cancel anyone who disagreed with them. That's why you all left X...Elon put a stop to your BS. Hypocrites...the group of ""acceptance"" refusing to accept criticism of your perversions & BS"

8020,24 November 2024 at 03:12,"Bluesky is much, much better. I left X a while ago and never missed that hellhole. Musk destroyed it."
8021,24 November 2024 at 02:30,Nobody with anything to say has left X. Have you left? 🤣🤡
8022,24 November 2024 at 03:45,I pulled the plug and fully left X. Feels nice
8023,24 November 2024 at 05:12,"I thought when I left X I'd also be leaving behind people who say ""tenant"" when they mean ""tenet"" but alas"
8024,23 November 2024 at 20:04,"@eastendjoe.bsky.social
 send you were the real deal.  I use bad words and sarcasm.  Left X long ago when it was Twitter and went to Threads.  
@bsky.app
 is better."
8025,23 November 2024 at 21:33,"I am one of those daily MSNBC viewers, haven't watched since Election Day and do not plan on returning! I stopped watching CNN a few years ago. Also left X after the Election, I'm now really enjoying BlueSky 💙"
8026,23 November 2024 at 21:57,"I left X a long time ago. I’m glad that folks are leaving and I hope it crashes and burns. 

But Walmart posted Thanksgiving advertising today and some of these just don’t post very often. That’s not quite the same thing as leaving."
8027,24 November 2024 at 00:36,"I’m worried that we colonized their online land and stomped all over them and got rid of them.

We owe it to the folks who were here before us to honor what they had here before we  left X. We are the foreigners in this online space, after all."
8028,23 November 2024 at 23:22,Bluesky is better than X…… (left X because someone decided to spread false info about me….)
8029,24 November 2024 at 00:48,I saw some comments today on this site where they are acknowledging that most of us left X and are over here so they are coming here with the intent to harass and troll. Must suck to be that miserable.
8030,24 November 2024 at 01:11,I'm blocking the followers of this guy. I left X because I don't want this trolling toxicity in my life.  Did you follow by accident? Why give the trolls that kind of support?
8031,23 November 2024 at 23:58,"I left X and (politics aside), I don't miss all the problems.  but as a news and sports guy, a LOT of sports and news accounts have to get their asses over here."
8032,23 November 2024 at 02:57,They’re just big mad that they only have themselves to attack now that so many people left X and refuse to interact with them here.
8033,23 November 2024 at 00:36,I left X the moment he bought it.. I missed it so when I learned about this app I jumped at it lol
8034,22 November 2024 at 23:45,"I Left X today as we all know It used to be twitter,
Blue Sky gave me same Vibe as old twitter used to give….
Off I go on a journey of this platform and exploring new world of SM…."
8035,22 November 2024 at 23:52,"@robisraelart.bsky.social
 he just left x"
8036,23 November 2024 at 00:59,No I temporarily left X.  I’ll be back soon
8037,15 November 2024 at 23:24,"I've left X. It will take me some time to adjust to this new platform. Hopefully, it will stay friendly."
8038,23 November 2024 at 01:18,following. 👍🏼 I left X for good!
8039,23 November 2024 at 02:11,"New to this app. So, glad I left 
#X

 took over."
8040,23 November 2024 at 02:26,I am ready for followers. I left X.
8041,23 November 2024 at 02:18,Glad you are here! Just sent you a DM on X telling you I've left X & moved here!
8042,23 November 2024 at 02:22,"Sooo... I redirected SmallestDick.com to Elon's X account.
I left X.
I came here."
8043,19 November 2024 at 00:46,"""Let's make fun of liberals and their insane takes"" I left X because of rape jokes, abuse threats and the generally not feeling safe on that platform as a woman.... and we are the insane ones??"
8044,18 November 2024 at 08:11,Yall left X for this? 💀
8045,19 November 2024 at 01:50,Yall left X for this? 💀

New here just left X it was terrible praise God"
8047,19 November 2024 at 15:16,Good Morning BlueSky! I have finally left X...all done over there...and looking to find my Ed Techy people here. I miss my PLN!
8048,19 November 2024 at 14:30,"Ah, and to think I left X, and I'm having a coloscopy next week!"
8049,19 November 2024 at 16:01,"@cbcstephenquinn.bsky.social
 nice spot on Bluesky this am. Personally (and happily) I left x."

 Have a big Respect for you💙
Also on Twitter
Left X 2022 was great for 11 years😁
Had Covid in 2020

SO SUSH!!"
8054,26 November 2024 at 08:30,That post might have good intentions but that doesn't make the claims true. And YOU are not deciding who can be where and say what and what is an insult or not. That's exactly why you left X. Because you cannot dominate over others. Over there you can't live out your little hitlarian world view.
8055,26 November 2024 at 05:30,"OK folks. A whole lotta you folks out there act like you've been held hostage by Twitter/X. It's almost as if you have PTSD. If you have left X, then don't be concerned about X anymore. Enjoy your freedom and chat away here and leave X far, far, far behind you. None of us care about how bad X is."
8056,26 November 2024 at 01:27,"Worst idea!... Forcing people to buy your product is always a bad idea! I left X b/c I discovered Tweets on my thread, that I created, were being deleted! THAT'S NOT REAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH..."
8057,26 November 2024 at 00:33,All of us who have left X have already obeyed in advance.
8058,25 November 2024 at 21:16,I never left X.  I think my first post there was the same day as my first post here.
8059,25 November 2024 at 22:06,"Ok so liberals left x because of liberals?

Just say your life is nothing more than ""owning libs"" or something. That's your personality. You're just a shitty person who wants others to know how shitty you are."

8062,26 November 2024 at 02:20,"For context a lot of the super amazing people in the Disney parks fandom (mainly the artists and other close friends) had left X/Twitter, looking for people to talk to I tried to check out other accounts. Almost all of them being dedicated to hating the Disney parks most of the time"
8063,26 November 2024 at 01:45,"I left X forever ago, just joined Bluesky this weekend, and I see this today. How is this still going on with her? She is obsessed! Hope everything else is good with you."
8064,26 November 2024 at 02:05,"Hi Mr. WARmonger.  I’m happy to see you here.  I’m a nondescript social media person so I’m sure you don’t remember me but I love your stuff and agree with you lost of the time but not every single time!

I left X back in August because it was just a pile of nonsense being shoveled at me."
8065,27 November 2024 at 08:04,"I have no idea. I have neither.
I know a lot of people left X and used instagram/threads. That's where a lot of ""X- refugees"" went"

 I had a great uncle I was close to taught me alot,He had a sayin don't beat up who's done you wrong get um where it hurts in the pocketbook everyone on here that hasnt left X yet do so now The more that leaves X the More it hurts Elon where he's got to sell and loses $ and we all want that"
8067,27 November 2024 at 14:13,He’s mad because everyone left X so he’s gonna sic his fascism on us gladiator style🤣
8068,27 November 2024 at 13:46,I haven’t left X but Ive been logged out for days and I think it’s the best thing I’ve done all year.
8069,27 November 2024 at 10:41,"So, according to my feed here and the amount of political content that get >15k views, most of them left 'X' bc they considered that there weren't free to speech there, but the fact is that they left it bc they don' t want to receive opposite thought answers 🤔
Sorry, but that's pretty childishly 🤷🏻‍♂️"
8070,27 November 2024 at 10:30,"Unfortunately I think they follow people here because all they do is bully and so many people left X now. Fortunately, the block button works properly here which is small comforts."
8071,27 November 2024 at 13:36,"That’s why I haven’t completely left X yet! Trumplicans are so much fun to pick on! All you need to do is state actual facts, or give verifiable evidence, and it pisses them off to no end!"
8072,27 November 2024 at 12:57,That's why she left X. I'm proud that we made it hard for her.
8073,27 November 2024 at 14:25,"Hi Mara— Great to hear from you! I’m afraid that I, my station, and NPR left “X” long before the “great migration!” Best to all!"
8074,26 November 2024 at 03:38,"Left X today. Felt like I let loose a 50 pound impacted turd; the sense of relief is amazing. Bluesky isn't perfect, but it's far better than Elon's Mount Trash more.5"
8075,27 November 2024 at 02:22,"Oh, GREAT! A very big reason I left X a year ago was because I was getting slammed with pornographic messages from women. I’m an old female who prefers catching up on the news. These often gross messages are not welcomed. 
I’ve blocked the ones I’ve gotten. I’ll go back to 
x-words if it continues."
8076,27 November 2024 at 02:27,I just left X. It was super easy.
8077,27 November 2024 at 03:57,💙💙💙 would appreciate a follow back from like minded fellow resistance members who left X hoping to rebuild a new coalition on Bluesky.
8078,27 November 2024 at 02:38,I left X when the new terms of service came into effect.  So I haven’t been there for several weeks.
8079,26 November 2024 at 23:18,Many are just getting starting on here I know its its been around few years but many people are on here also. Lots are jumping from X to BlueSky I left X myself.
8080,27 November 2024 at 16:37,Some of you haven't left X behind and it shows.
8081,27 November 2024 at 16:49,"Hey,
Glad you’re in Bluesky! I left X."
8082,27 November 2024 at 14:50,Exactly why I left. X has become a seriously poisonous platform since Elon took it over and invited everyone from 4 chan and Stormfront. 😒
8083,3 December 2024 at 20:16,"#TeamFollowBack
 
I left X and never looked back. I dont want a ""Lot's wife"" experience"
8084,3 December 2024 at 20:14,"As I move between X and BlueSky, I see a pattern emerging: Many who’ve left X for BlueSky seem to carry their disdain for X with them, making bashing it almost a cultural norm on BlueSky.

BlueSky’s decentralized ethos seems to amplify anti-X sentiments, almost like a collective rallying cry."
8085,4 December 2024 at 03:15,Left X Nov 6th and never looked back. It was absolutely freeing.
8086,4 December 2024 at 02:59,"I left X, I couldn’t stand the lies, gaslighting and bs"
8087,4 December 2024 at 02:04,"A lotta mad ignorant people left X and came to Bluesky after the election. A lot of celebrities, especially."
8088,4 December 2024 at 04:25,You left X to avoid listening to an opposing viewpoint.

What is this shit... I don't even agree with a lot of things Mutahar says and does but he gets so much racism...

Like how he left X bc ppl kept spamming him ""poo skin"" jokes and hating him for being Indian."

8105,30 November 2024 at 12:03,I left X because it was boring.
8106,30 November 2024 at 14:05,"Left X when Darren Grimes blocked me .I really enjoyed calling out his hate harvesting and lies. Going to have to find a new hobby now. I already crochet, garden, am a governor in a school, teach French, bake, do Wordle ,Connections, read murder mysteries, historical fiction and walk our puppy."
8107,29 November 2024 at 11:52,Musk is already proving to be mean and inappropriate. It's dangerous to have him in our government. I left X.

Just invading spaces of Black people to attack them with comments about “DEI or Trump” on posts that have nothing to do with politics 😒 They really aren’t happy unless they’re attacking us.

Yesterday, I searched for all Elons, and blocked them all. I left X Hell, I don’t want/need him on here for my timeline. Wondering if it’s just me?"
8131,29 November 2024 at 19:24,"Glad I left X, especially after hearing an interview with preeminent neuroscientist Sam Harris, who had a long-standing friendship with Musk, that he is now a full-blown ketamine addict, which might help explain how Musk went from being awkward and arrogant to menacing  and deranged."
8132,29 November 2024 at 22:32,I left X because I thought it was toxic. Elon runs it like his personal toy. Elon Musk is a total dick for supporting Donald Trump. I really do not like Elon orTrump. I shutter to think what will happen to my country in the next 4 years with those two bozos in the White House.
8133,29 November 2024 at 23:42,I left x mainly because of the change to the block feature.   It’s much friendlier here.

8136,29 November 2024 at 20:30,It’s hard to have a good faith discussion about Tesla on Bluesky since so many left X specifically because of Elon.  Anything about Tesla is mostly an echo chamber here unfortunately.
8137,29 November 2024 at 22:35,"Hello world. I just joined this site today. I left X a month ago, but I've missed tweeting."
8138,27 November 2024 at 21:58,Exactly why we all left X
8139,29 November 2024 at 21:33,"Yeah, I don’t think his platform will come even close to what Elon’s going to Twitter. I left X with about 12,000 people following me."
8140,30 November 2024 at 21:11,I am struggling with all that too. I think it will take time. I haven’t left X either. I am tiring of the nasty people there!

8143,30 November 2024 at 22:52,And like 3 of the Bluesky users have actually left X. So…….. what’s the point?

A point that’s being proven now… but the admin decided it was more important to stay, even though their reach there was minuscule. A poor choice."
8146,1 December 2024 at 06:13,"Hi there! Like so many others I have left X now.
Now I have to get used to this I guess. And find new friends, find my crowd.
Truckers, horrorfans, nutcases, where are ye? 🥰"
8147,1 December 2024 at 07:50,And yet everyone that left X when Elon took over claiming to never go back suddenly were back on the app then   I guess the idea to take it back failed miserably 🫵😂

8150,1 December 2024 at 11:42,No I’m not at all.  I just don’t want to engage with rude people - that’s why I left X.  I have no intention of engaging with them all over again on here.

Democrats: Loyalty to tribe 
Suppression of Opposition: legacy media
Social Regimentation: So socially pushy (cultists) some even left X so they could not see anything other than their narrative. 
Centralized AUTOCRATIC government, like the one in charge pardoned ALL acts by Hunter."

I left DeviantArt and never went back for the very same reasons I left X; It became a reactionary cesspool that became impossible to operate on without being harassed by Anti-SJW trash."
8168,30 November 2024 at 10:58,"I left X because after Elon Musk criticized Twitter for suppressing the Hunter Biden Laptop story for 1 day, and he has now at the request of Trump suppressed the JD Vance dossier indefinitely. Also Elon listening to more government requests than Twitter did, the percentage is way higher. He lied."

For a decade, fossil fuel has funded massive disinformation and bots about Tesla.

8175,1 December 2024 at 20:07,"A friend of mine left X a couple of months before I did. I asked them why, and they said, ""Elon's an asshole. If you do something and go viral, even though it's you that has the attention, Elon ultimately profits from that.""

8177,1 December 2024 at 17:45,The one thing I like about this laughable story? The replies. Notice how mostly every comment is on point and doesn’t divulge into a personal attack? That’s why people left X.

8187,1 December 2024 at 15:13,lol yeah right because anybody that doesn't worship trump as a God is a pedo rapist. This is why we left X. Now tell me how we will all be rounded up and sent to concentration camps simply for refusing to vote for an adjudicated rapist scumbag.😆

8212,28 November 2024 at 05:52,Maybe that many left X - because it’s not Twitter anymore- that’s why I’m leaving
8213,28 November 2024 at 13:10,"I feel that block lists give too much control of your feed to someone else which is what people left X for. It's fairly easy to curate your own experience, such as you're doing.

8217,28 November 2024 at 11:05,"In addition, I think that people left X not because of Elon Musk's support for Trump, but because E. Musk flooded X with only his content, de facto editorialising X (and killing diversity on the platform). And just like with ""traditional"" media, users switched."
8218,28 November 2024 at 16:37,I left X so I didn't have to see his garbage.
8219,28 November 2024 at 17:18,One of the reasons that I moved to Bluesky from Tribel (I’d left X long ago) was that I was being hit up by a bunch of skanks (I’m guessing they were Russian Bots). Unfortunately they are showing up here on Bluesky now.
8220,28 November 2024 at 16:02,It’s true though. It’s really awkward how all the yucky people left x and went to Bluesky. Not saying everyone on Bluesky is involved. But the mass of democrats are honestly blind and manipulated to think all these democrats are innocent. Ally Carter was raped by Biden under the Getty 2 years ago.

Go ahead & call someone a ""n---er"" on X & see what happens to you.

NOTHING!!

8231,29 November 2024 at 04:38,"So I left X. X for some reason to me felt like something out of a George Orwell novel. In 1984, the Party uses propaganda as its main weapon to control citizens, instill loyalty, and confuse them.

8234,27 November 2024 at 18:07,I didn’t leave X because I’m liberal (I’m moderate).  I left X because access to posts was being manipulated by its Owner.  I think MAGA doesn’t get that.  Some of us LIKE thinking for ourselves.
